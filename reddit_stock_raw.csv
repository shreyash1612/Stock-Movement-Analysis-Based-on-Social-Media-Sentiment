1esq66l,stocks,"Post: Does AMD seem ridiculously underpriced to anyone else? Thinking about moving some of my MSFT/AMZN money into AMD. 

After the Intel crash, I looked into some other stocks and notixed that AMD is down 20% in the past 6 months. After some googling, I found that many publications are hyping it, and that it's 6% up this week. 

I feel like moving some of my underperforming Amazon stocks into AMD could be the right call, but Amazon seems way underpriced right now too. 

Thoughts?

1. Not a bad time to buy in since AMD is still recovering after the latest dip. But trading AMZN/MSFT for AMD is not something I would do.
2. By which metrics is it underpriced?
3. “Underperforming Amazon stock”….?! What??? Have you owned it for five minutes?

That said, based on your post, I would seriously recommend you not buy individual stocks. Stick with the broad market index, and you will become rich anyways.
4. I expect it to rise a lot in the next few months. Main reasons as to why are


1. Intel basically losing all credibilty and skipping the current CPU release cycle.


2. AMD ramping up AI accelerator production, which while miles behind NVDA, still make a great alternative.


Also, AMD is still writing off profits because of the Xilinx acquisition. Once it is fully written off you can expect the profits to suddenly jump (i expect a positive overreaction of the market here).


I'm no expert though so do with that information what you will.
5. I would buy AVGO over AMD. I would not sell AMZN.",15-08-2024 08:41

https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1224/amd-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results


Segment Summary

Record Data Center segment revenue of $3.5 billion was up 122% year-over-year and 25% sequentially primarily driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct™ GPU shipments and growth in AMD EPYC™ CPU sales.

Client segment revenue was $1.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year and 26% sequentially primarily driven by strong demand for “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ processors. 

Gaming segment revenue was $462 million, down 69% year-over-year and 29% sequentially primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue.
Embedded segment revenue was $927 million, down 25% year-over-year as customers normalized their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8% as demand improved in several end markets.

1. The results seem good, so why's the stock falling?
2. For people wondering why it’s down, probably because the future guidance isn’t strong enough within the industry. Nvidia’s exceptional performance could be influencing the judgement of other companies in the sector. Still, solid earnings but they need to capitalise more while Intel are weak.
3. Oh no, it has fallen down to the lowest price since...*checks notes*...last thursday!
4. i was wondering if nvda would move based on this, guess not much
5. and yet, Mr. (after)Market is unhappy and punishing the stock with 8% crash.

1gqonzv,stocks,"Post: AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees

AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

1e6ebif,stocks,"Post: AMD the buy of the week? 

AMD is down roughly 15% as of right now. I currently just bought $2000 worth. It's possible it could go down further. However, I think it being down 15% is a good buy-in price. I think it is a better buy/value as of right now compared to Nvidia. This isn't me trashing Nvida still a good a stock just I believe AMD is a better buy as of this moment. Thoughts on this move? I might contribute more but undecided right now.  

Top Comments:
1. My rule of thumb, the day a massive drop off happens you always wait until middle of the second day to see what it is doing. 80% of the time the second day has residual sellers, lowering it more then it evens out.
2. It's a good buy long term but just understand that it is fully capable of tanking another 20-30%. It tanked by more than 60% in 2022 but that ended up being a massive buying opportunity.
3. Too many amateur investors think a company needs to be the best at what it does for the stock to be a good buy. Clearly that helps, but Nvidia has had a massive run up already. AMD has been treated as the ugly duckling because its products are nowhere near as good as Nvidia's for AI applications.

That's true, but I can see AMD being a multi bagger at these levels without even catching up to Nvidia's tech. All it needs to do is beat expectations from either the tech front or sales, and expectations are fairly low at the moment. 

Remember long ago when AMD's GPUs were considered trash vs Nvidia for gaming, and its CPUs were discount bin equivalent to Intel? Then from improving their products (but still not becoming the best) and gaining market share the shares became multibaggers. The people trashing AMD now for not being as good as Nvidia on AI applications would have been the same people trashing AMD stock back then telling you it's a terrible buy. Shares and the market are driven by expectations, not just by who does what best. 

I already trimmed my Nvidia position a bit a couple of weeks ago, and I've now stuck some into AMD after yesterday's selloff.

The fun part is that people who pick stocks like to mention how anyone would be 1000+% up if they picked Tesla, Netflix, AMD 5 years ago, etc. However, 5 years later they still pick the same stocks that turned into MEGA corporations and have far less room to grow.

It just shows how investors became lazy and stopped doing their research, which is never good. Companies like Meta and Intel are great examples how strongholds may fall one day and having all eggs in one basket with overvalued mega corporations is never a good thing.

It is also a beginner’s mistake to think that you have to find the $1 billion dollar market cap company that will get to $20 billion. More of these will cut in half than those that 20x their market cap.

1dca52c,stocks,"Post: Riding the AMD Wave

Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.

# Current Play:

So, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing.

# Analyst Chatter:

The street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown:

* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.”
* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating.
* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.”
* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target.
* **Wedbush:** Stays “outperform” with a $200 target.

Overall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.

# Financial Pulse:

Earnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.

Key ratios to watch:

* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.
* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.
* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market.

# Insider Moves:

Now, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.

# Institutional Maneuvers:

Big players are piling in:

* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.
* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.
* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.
* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.

# My Strategy:

**Technical Setup:**

* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.
* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.

**Entry Points:**

* **Short-Term:** I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.
* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up.

**Exit Strategy:**

* **Short-Term Gains:** I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win.
* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there.

# Market Conditions:

Keep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.

# The Bottom Line:

AMD’s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It’s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let’s see how this ride goes!

Cheers to smart trading! 🥂

Pretty simple question I have for a stock that I've had since 2022.

I'm up +$748.45 on AMD Stock Bought on an average cost basis of $89.63. As the saying goes Pigs get slaughtered and now I'm trying to think when I should sell this stock but I also don't want to sell if it can go even higher than say maybe $230-$250 per share. AMD is currently my best stock in my portfolio but I also don't want to be greedy. What are everyone's opinions on this?

2. I’d hold AMD but I’m just some idiot on Reddit who also holds AMD.
3. If NVDA rips on earnings, everything AI will.
4. I think AMD is a decent long term hold but this comes from bias! I think Nvidia & AMD are here to stay. You see the names everywhere now.
5. I withdrew my initial investment on AMD in January at $165, then it went up another $55. Now we're back at $165 so I guess it wasn't a bad decision?

tv20la,stocks,"Post: One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.

**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**

Top Comments:
1. The only thing I can comment on with 100% certainty is that there will be another video game console cycle after ps5/series x.

0% chance gaming goes full cloud before the next generation of consoles come out.

Edit: If you want a simple thesis for this, look no further than Elden Ring. It will be at least 5-6 years (god knows how long really) from now before you could experience that game at its fullest through cloud (no latency, all graphics and performance running identical to playing on a series x/ps5).

Let's not forget as well that in that time, the graphical and performance standards will increase as well. Gamers will not go backwards in graphics/performance just to play something on cloud. Gamers will seek out the OPTIMAL way to play something with the best performance. I would think peak performance may always be on a physical console or pc, or at least there will always be a market for it.  Cloud may get better, but running it on your own machine will always have more potential IMO.
2. Lisa Su conservative guidance is 30% YOY revenue. Last year she said 37%.

Lisa Su says that the best is yet to come.

Lisa Su says that incremental gains in chip volume will occur each quarter.

&#x200B;

She has not been wrong yet. One day she will be, but I will wait to see the next 3 years.

You believe that NVDA is worth the price tag? You think that MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN can grow profits faster and longer than AMD? I will grant that they are stable, but with the growth numbers MSFT is putting out they should be at a share price of 200 not 300.
3. One year ago AMD was $80, it's now $108 so not exactly bearish but it's a big drop from the high 6 months ago. You make a lot of valid points but you leave out the jockeys riding the horse and as long as Dr Su is running AMD I will continue to hold AMD.
4. You completely ignored a 30 billion dollar acquisition dude.

I understand they had to reduce their growth outlook for Q4 but they are still doing super good comparing them with other tech giants.

1af0cc0,stocks,"Post: AMD shares fall as first-quarter forecast comes in light

Here’s how the company did versus LESG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus estimates for the quarter ended in December:

EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected

Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected


For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.

Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.

AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.

In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.

But historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.

Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.

However, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.

AMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

Sales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

1. Pretty solid report but lower margins than NVDA. Market is simply overbought. Would expect a 7-12 percent pull back before next leg up, companies that went up huge like AMD may see a larger pull back but pretty standard.
2. Me thinks it's going to be bloody tomorrow and, perhaps, for the rest of the months. Tack on the fact that February is not typically a good month for stocks and you can guess what the next month is going to feel like.
3. Guidance for AI chips went from 2 billion to 3.5 billion.  Waiting for the call for more details.  That is bullish.

Comparing AMD to Nvidia, Nvidia is well positioned to continue to be the dominant gpu maker for AI and AMD is not

Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 82

Amd has a P/E ratio of 327

Why would anyone would invest in a stock with a poorer outlook than nvidia and a higher P/E? It seems extremely overpriced.

Maybe I am just a noob tho and missing something here.

Top Comments:
1. just commenting on the P/E ratio, it's inflated due to the Xilinx acquisition
2. As others have pointed out, P/E alone is a pretty terrible metric to base investment analysis on when taken in isolation.

4. >Isn't AMD extremely overpriced, am I missing something?

That's literally what people asked when Nvidia shot up before their big AI earnings. I don't know, personally, but just saying.

The stock market is trading future expectations and AMD has delivered strong growth in revenue the last years.

https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/amd/financials/

The trailing PE ratio is 1,189.55 and the forward PE ratio is 39.31. AMD has completed its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx.

A look at their latest numbers.

In the fourth quarter of their 2022 fiscal year, Xilinx generated 600 million U.S. dollars in revenue, the only quarter to be reported by AMD as a separate entity before the company's operations were incorporated into other AMD business segments.

A look at their past reports shows that there is a potential of a 1000 million quarterly profit.

4. I like how intel is out of the question
5. NVDA and AMD are always champing at the bit trying to get ahead of the other. As such, there’s always a great ebb and flow between the two. When one pushes ahead, the other lacks behind. If you go long on both, look at who’s currently doing better. Roll more into the other. AMD was crushing it last year then intel dropped the 10th and subsequently, 11th gen processors and pulled ahead again. My portfolio more heavily favored Intel and I came out ahead.

1ew1fx0,stocks,"Post: AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock

Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

1. Interesting acquisition. I guess they will try to catch up to Nvidia through a slightly different direction.
2. I like AMD... interesting factod.

Lisa and Jensen are cousins.
3. How big is ZT systems and what is their coverage in AI? Do they develop models, have any large recurring customers?
4. I dont understand why they refuse to change strategies and just double down on taking over Intel at the CPU category. Intel still dominates the CPU servers and most cloud virtual machines use Intel + NVIDIA as combination. Why not instead of playing a game against a behemoth in NVIDIA, just strive to gain the monopoly of CPUs. Besides, there will definitely come a time when small, distilled, pruned AI models can be hosted fast in CPU-only VM deployments.
5. Forever a follower - share taking instead of market making.


Downvoting this won't change the facts - NVDA targeted servers over a decade ago. There's a reason they've 10x earnings and AMD has not. Maybe leave a thought with your downvote worth talking about?

i9avyi,stocks,"Post: AMD CEO sold $15.9 millions worth of AMD stock

According to the SEC filing, here are a couple of high-profile AMD insider selling for the past couple days:

1. Lisa Su (CEO): sold $11.8M worth of AMD stock in Aug 11, and sold $4.1M in Aug 9.
2. KUMAR DEVINDER (CFO): sold $5M in Aug 11, and sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
3. Bergman Rick (EVP): $1.9M in Aug 9.
4. Papermaster Mark D (CTO): sold $1.25M in Aug 9.
5. GRASBY PAUL DARREN (SVP & CSO): sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
6. Norrod Forrest Eugene (SVP): $934k in Aug 9
7. WOLIN HARRY A (SVP): sold $698k in Aug 9.
8. SMITH DARLA M (CAO): sold $332k in Aug 9.

That is a total of $28.4M in 2 days, which is a lot of profit-taking for a short amount of time.

Will this trend continue as AMD price keeps hitting ATH? Quite possible. This means that more volatility is coming for AMD, which we have already seen recently with all these crazy swings. So don't YOLO/FOMO into AMD because of all the hype.

All,

If you had to choose between picking one of these companies right now, which one would you go for?

AMD is obviously quite expensive, over inflated right now and a lot is banking on their AI chips to kick off and get in the market. So far they have been steady grabbing market share for PCs and servers but Qualcomm is expected to come in a new competitor.

Apple has already proved the value of ARM based CPUs and if Qualcomm can do the same for Windows laptops then that's gonna spell trouble for amd and Intel.

What do you guys think?

qra2t4,stocks,"Post: People who made high-conviction buys into NVDA or AMD years ago -- what was your process?

We often hear stories here about how people got into AMD or NVDA at $10. That's fantastic but I would like to know:

> **How did you find these great buys and can we duplicate your process?**

And

> **Using that same method, what current stocks look like the next AMD or NVDA (before they mooned)?**

We're especially interested in stories that describe a great research method that hopefully we can duplicate.

A couple of caveats:

* You can share other stories that's not AMD or NVDA, but try to keep it in the tech growth sector if possible.

* Try to avoid stories of ""Well it was so cheap so I just Yolo"" or ""I heard it on Reddit."" That's great for you but it's not a process we can duplicate. Remember, it must be a ""high conviction"" buy for you, not just a random dart throw.

1. Imagine you love computers, you want to build a computer. You have other computer lovers in your social circle you ask them for some ideas for good components. You realize you just spent a few grand to build your computer. You know the brands you bought, you know the brands that were suggested to you. You check the market and realize its a publicly traded company. Might not even be that old a year maybe two, you like the products you bought so you decided to invest in the stock you add to your position over time and three years later you end up with an $11 average on AMD and its sitting in the 130s/140s.
2. Nvda was an obvious “company of the future” for me at the time (around 2015) when I learned more about semiconductors and the need for them in cloud computing. My first buy was in the mid 60s. I believe at that time AMD was around $9, and I remember buying at the “peak” at $14 and worrying I had made a mistake.
3. Dudes on reddit mentioned NET. Bought at 60. Sold at 207. Thanks for watching my ted talk
4. when i first started investing, I was like humm what should i buy. I thought abt Tesla and at the time I thought Tesla was the cool new kid in the block, and I like Elon, so i was like heck yeah let me buy some. So i bought 64 shares of Tesla for $610 pre split. It went up to 1000 and came back down to 700, so I came to this sub for advice, people told me to sell cuz it's overvalued. so I sold at $680.  

&#x200B;

Then I heard people mentioning Nio, and being Chinese, I have seen Nio been talking abt on Chinese forum as the new cool electric car, so I bought it 5000 shares a 3 dollar. It went up to 7.50 in a few days, I was so stoked, so I came to this forum and people was like, sell it. you never go broke for taking profits, so I sold it. 

&#x200B;

Had I kept both stocks, they are worth over half a million today.

don't fucking come here for advice, no one know what the fuck they are talking abt.
5. After school I started working as a data scientist, decided to save money in stocks put them into stuff that sounded familiar from work plus that nvdia was the only ones making graphic cards that we could use for our computations and we knew deep learning was gonna blow up in the coming years so it was a no brainer. Then I bought some AMD as well cause I figured they were nvidias number 1 competition so I just wanted to cover my bets. Still barely know anything about the two companies or stocks or investments really but those two and getting into bitcoin and ether in 2017 has made me not have to worry about retirement anymore.

viyn5d,stocks,"Post: AMD stock now at a ‘reasonable valuation’ after near-50% pullback, Morgan Stanley says

If the semiconductor surge comes to an end, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could be best positioned to sustain the pullback, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote Wednesday.

AMD AMD, -0.05% shares performed slightly better Wednesday compared with those of other chip makers, which saw shares decline overall, after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the stock now that Xilinx, which was acquired in February, is firmly a part of AMD. Morgan Stanley was identified as the lead financial adviser for Xilinx, when the deal was announced in October 2020.

Analyst Joseph Moore established an overweight rating and $103 price target, writing that the company “offers potential for solid numbers at a reasonable valuation,” given its near-50% selloff from late-November highs. “Overall, we are optimistic that the company’s prospects in data center (CPU, GPU, and FPGA) will provide enough growth to drive further positive estimate revisions over the next several quarters,” Moore said in a note.

AMD shored up its data-center offerings when it closed on its purchase of Xilinx, which specializes in field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, chips that can be configured by a customer or a designer after they are made. Those chips, in turn, are used as accelerators in data centers to boost computing power and improve power efficiency in existing physical spaces. 

“Apprehensions we see in the consumer linked end-markets should leave AMD less exposed comparatively than key competitors, allowing us to underwrite conservative numbers that shouldn’t surprise much to the downside,” Moore said.

Analysts are concerned that the explosion in semiconductor sales amid a pandemic-influenced supply crunch could lead to a severe downturn in the months ahead, as inventories build and customers halt purchases. That has been a major factor in a strong downturn for chip stocks in the first half of the year. “While a digestion phase in PCs and consoles appears likely, and we are budgeting for some caution next year, we believe strength in server (with further market share gains) should allow the company to keep posting solid growth at a now reasonable valuation,” Moore said.

Separately, AMD announced late Wednesday it appointed Mathew Hein to the position of chief strategy officer, effective Monday. Hein comes from investment banking firm DBO Partners, where he was lead adviser to AMD “on a number of opportunities.” Up until 2013, Hein worked at Morgan Stanley for 17 years, where Hein held positions such as Technology Investment Banking Group managing director, and global head of Semiconductor Banking. Reporting directly to AMD Chief Executive and Chair Lisa Su, “Hein will be responsible for advancing the company’s strategy across an expanded market for high-performance and adaptive computing solutions and will work closely with the AMD executive team to accelerate the company’s next phase of growth.”

Earlier in the month, AMD doubled-down on its commitment to expand its data center offerings, and forecast average annual revenue growth of about 20% over the next three to four years, while sticking to its second-quarter and annual forecast provided in early May. 

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect revenue of $6.43 billion for the second quarter, compared with AMD’s estimated $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, and $26.2 billion for the year, based on AMD’s estimate of about $26.3 billion.

Looking as Tesla, Nvidia, NET etc.  AMD is growing greater than 60% again this year, taking market share basically every q in data center and PC from Intel.  And yet people would rather bet on completely pie in the sky robotaxies.

1afxwfr,stocks,"Post: Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA

I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.

Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. 

The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. 

Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. 

I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.

2. Cherry picks margin numbers not accounting for the fact that AMD is still writing off expenses associated with the Xilinx merger that affects reported profits which is also why their trailing P/E is so ridiculously high.  Only looking at reported margins is a poor way to compare the two.
3. Are you ignoring equity in the comp packages? Because at VP+ levels that is an extremely significant component.

Feels like your stats are cherry picked and not acknowledging AMD is smaller and clearly the underdog vs NVDA which has been big dog for a long time hence the better margins.
4. Can't take you seriously when you start talking about the executive compensations. 🤡  Drizzles on the sea
5. I lost you at superior technology. Who are you to claim that. CUDA doesn’t matter anymore, chiplets lead to stronger yields and mi300 is performing at parity with H100. Not sure what superior technology you are referring to, it’s a scaling out issue not technology issue.",01-02-2024 00:45

1anrsxh,stocks,"Post: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy

\#AMD’s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don’t believe it will get close to Nvidia’s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  
It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.

$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  
However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  
For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  
EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  
Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  
Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  
Guidance was light:  
Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  
Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  
Client Group - The recovery in PC’s helped AMD’s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  
Gaming, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD’s overall margins.  
AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there.

But tbh AMD is pretty expensive right now. 45 times earnings with slower growth than NVIDIA at 25 times earnings.

1frpnji,stocks,"Post: AI Plays: NVD, AMD, GOOGL + a Couple Broader Questions

What’s up people,

Hope everyone is good. Posting this in hopes of getting some discussion about AI and possible investments going.

For context, with all the talk about AI going on, I've been trying to learn what I can about it. I don’t have any relevant background or expertise, but I’ve increasingly felt compelled to learn about it so I'm at least not totally ignorant. At this point, I’ve mostly been watching YouTube interviews of Altman/Zuckerberg/Gates types, along with lectures that Stanford makes available.

In the midst of this, I watched two videos in which separate AI researchers mentioned a [2019 blog post titled “The Bitter Lesson.”](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Apparently, this blog post was written by a computer scientist and is really influential in the field. One of the main takeaways, as I understand it, is that all that really matters for improving AI is providing more computing power.

Given how much the tech community seems to believe this, I decided to make a few plays in the space, buying literally just a few shares of NVDA, AMD, and GOOGL earlier this week. NVDA and GOOGL are obviously some of the biggest names in the space, albeit in different aspects. I took a chance on AMD, even though people seem to say their tech isn't as good, just because I still feel like it could rise with the rest of the field as long as people keep thinking AI is the future.

To be candid, I’m cynical about about how AI will be used and, more broadly, I don’t really think this is a great time to just now be getting into the market- from my perspective, it still seems like a lot of people are burnt out from work/life, and the companies that are making more money seem to be doing so largely by raising prices. I’m not sure how sustainable it all is without some sort of correction. Still, I wanted to get a little skin in the game so that I’m motivated to keep learning.

If anyone finds any of this worth talking about, I have two ongoing questions at this point:

1)    What really excites people in the field about generative AI/large language models from a technological/computer science perspective? For example, when blockchain was blowing up, I heard it said that Blockchain was exciting because it made it possible to transfer a digital file such that the original sender no longer possessed the file after sending. Regardless of my personal opinions on the technology, that explanation at least made sense to me, and I could imagine possible applications and why people might be excited. What is it about AI that likewise has tech experts so excited really? What specifically does it allow them to do that they could never do before, and why is that valuable?

2)    Outside of the people running tech companies, who is really positioned to benefit from AI? In nearly every video I see of Sam Altman talking, he says something like, “I believe AI will have a positive net benefit on society overall.” I wonder, though, how he would measure this. It seems to me like AI will help any company or user that can leverage it to make money, but could end up harming a lot of employees and end consumers. I feel like it could just accelerate trends of companies extracting more and more money from the rest of the population. I'm really not trying to make this political or turn it into a debate on capitalism. That’s just my honest gut feeling about it from an economic perspective at this point. I see it providing a lot of benefit to a relatively small segment of the population.

Would be interested to hear what other people think and if/how you are investing in the space. I'd even like to know if people here actually use AI in their personal lives. And if anyone has resources that they feel have helped deepen their knowledge about AI, I’d really appreciate you sharing. I feel like I’ve kind of hit a wall trying to get beyond surface-level discussions about the field.

Cheers.

1. GOOG just seems like an obvious buy. It's priced low right now and they're throwing a lot of money at AI infrastructure. Even if they don't use it directly the can lease out the ML servers in the new data centers they're building.  NVDA is great but GOOG covers so many different area whereas NVDA and amd just make chips. 

Disclaimer- I own all 3
2. Just track QQQM and you’ll get exposure to all the big AI plays
3. Here is an [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/13xempk/some_ai_apps_by_category/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that may help with a visual presentation.

For me, the hardware will become commoditized but the question is when - I personally suspect in 5 years.

In my opinion, the generational winners will be companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare, i.e., drug discovery , possibly UNH or research hospital like MSK or Duke Univ), defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty programs (they know a lot about you and your preference) or TSLA has more driving data, particularly for autonomous driving AI.

I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data set and how companies interrelate. I suspect they are already using it and being private do not publicize it, like APPL (who prefer to use the term Large Language Modeling)

MSFT except for OFFICE has been a follower or acquirer; they were way behind on AI and is the reason the partner with OpenAI and did better PR.

I will stick with Google.

I personally also suspect that APPL (I know they partner with OpenAI for the consumer front, but believe they have internal products) and AMZN have better AI tech as it is captive and will never be in the open market for competitive reasons.

There was a good new release of data is king and those that can exploit data will win. Isomorphic Labs partnering with LLY and NVS on drug discovery. If you can shorten drug discovery time and extend protection - it is a big win.
4. I would throw ANET into the AI bucket
5. NVDA is selling chips to Amazon, Google, Azure and also uses these cloud services. They now have them as customers and they also use their own chips sold to these cloud providers as consumers. Both get to claim AI hype is real and real world use cases. 



Besides this evey other production use case is around text generation and struggles with hallucinations, RAG for everything and struggle with long context or long conversations, synthetic data for many things but making sure there is no biases so essentially doing ML but now with expensive hardware with similar outcomes. These are qualified use cases and some more in call center, automated responses which can take advantage of NLP but only big tech companies can spend billions to make no money and still enjoy returns in form of marketcap rise due to hype. GenAI os as good and will stay as has blockchain. Only picks and shovel selling is profitable right now. It's an early innings but market cap for these semiconductor companies is unsustainable. NVDA especially is at risk of massive correction and maybe so many engineers have taken a break or left and sold their stocks to enjoy their time. Insider trading also shows everyone is selling and taking advantage of this high valuation with 10x jump in 2yrs. 

  
Tech is evolving but market cap for these picks and shovels company is crazy. So is it for AMD who is miserable behind on software stack that can support Training and doesn't scale too well for inference plus they have very low supply to  make any gains in market share. No one wants AMD and if NVDA hardware gets cheaper they will get another reason to not use AMD.",28-09-2024 22:18
10root9,stocks,"Post: CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated

AMD is ‘undershipping’ chips to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated
Less supply to balance out demand—and keep prices high.

As the PC industry flounders, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted pay cuts and other extreme measures going forward. AMD’s client PC sales also dropped dramatically—a whopping 51 percent year-over-year—but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren’t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).

“We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,” Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. “We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.”

With the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It’s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.

Despite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.

AMD isn’t the only one doing it, either.

“We’re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we’re seeing,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. “So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.”

Since then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD’s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.

Overall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD’s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).

This all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven’t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect—hope?—that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel’s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.

1. That's to reduce inventory, not (only) to keep prices high. They had a huge increase in inventory, so it would be useless to keep accumulating chips or  selling them for a low price.
2. it has nothing to do with keeping prices elevated. I dont even think how someone can be that stupid to really believe that. In that case nvidia and intel would just outsell them. zero logic. they had way too big inventory to ship new chips because consumers are buying way less. the prices are lower than before actually
3. super shitty move, from a consumer POV, but makes sense from their side.
4. Matching supply with demand is not a nefarious evil plot. AMD is doing what any competent business would do.
5. Where did she say they're doing this to keep prices elevated? That seems speculation.

Undershipping could also mean that they're shipping less than they're producing, which wouldn't affect prices or could even mean they'll continue to drop.",02-02-2023 12:29

1. Already up 10% after hours
2. Noob question here I’m genuinely puzzled ; why is Xilinx soaring while AMD is getting shit on pre market?
3. As an AMD shareholder, I don't like this deal. The two companies are on mostly separate sectors and customers so it'll be like two separate companies operating under a single name. I just don't see the synergy between these two besides some cost savings estimated $300 million a year which is meager compared to the expenses from both companies.

AMD is in a good position to increase market share over Intel. I fear this acquisition will distract AMD from that. That and I was anticipating a number close to the rumored $30 billion, not $35 billion (17% more).

Of all the other acquisitions AMD could've gotten with their extremely expensive stock price (PE over 100), they chose Xilinx which is about 30% of AMD's size. So no more taking advantage of its stock price to acquire other companies.

The CEO of Xilinx previously worked for CEO of AMD at AMD. I wonder if this deal would've happened at all or at this price without this relationship.

A lot good for Xilinx shareholders assuming AMD's stock price continues to maintain at this expensive price. Bad for AMD shareholders.

1eg3rmw,stocks,"Post: AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.

What's the overall thoughts on AMD and Intel?

About 2 years ago, it almost felt like Intel was just a blast from the past, AMD will finally be the next leader in the CPU market, at least thats what the stock prices looked like.

But then, Intels performance throughout this year has been a slow, but steady gain, while AMD has been well below its ATH.

What will the future bring? Intel has just recently confirmed its ramp in production capacity, while AMD as a fabless company is strongly dependent on foundries like TSMC, who, howerer, have already confirmed to prioritize apple, nvidia and then also intel with their 3nm node. Will AMD manage a way back to its former value, especially since the whole industry seems to be full of turbulences and uncertainty? Despite the overall damp in the consumer market, iIs intel still undervalued?

Top Comments:
1. Intel has been deemed a matter of national security by the current administration.
2. Intel is looking to become one of the leaders in semiconductor manufacturing and have government funding behind them.
3. Personally, I think Intel is preposterously cheap. I've been buying since $24.
4. About being fabless, Nvidia is also fabless and they are the 6th largest company in the world. Apple is the largest company and both of them rely on TSMC which is the 12th largest.

This is fine, with the margins Nvidia has the cost of manufacturing is minor. Their focus should be spent working on their technological advantage, which is what is allowing them to maintain those high margins.

Fabless means you can shop around and use whoever has the best silicon, which pushes your products further ahead. Having your own fabs can cut down on costs, but I don't think that's what neither Nvidia, Apple, AMD needs to do right now.

1. Look at it from this perspective . 

It’s either intel or AMD for processors. Go to your local Best Buy and see if you find much else available. 

Now, intel is facing shortages, is very expensive, and isn’t offering anything crazy in terms of new technology 

AMD has newer and smaller processors coming out, if you buy one for your PC if you custom build,it comes with a fan. AMD also does exceptionally well in graphics compared to Intel. 

Furthermore, AMD offers a LOT more performance/dollar. It is also better at multi core performance. 

The fact that the new Microsoft computers have allowed AMD to be part of their product line up when they’re competing with apple says a lot. 

I think it will grow more, they have many factors supporting them.
2. AMD is a fanatic company is Lisa Su is a fantastic CEO. I am an AMD customer for my laptop. However, from an INVESTOR standpoint, what upside you see in AMD? It has already gone from $2 to $83 in only a couple of years. It has a triple digit PE ratio, and a PEG of 5. It’s earnings could grow 50% a year for 5 years and at that point would it have a PE of 21, and that’s if the stock traded sideways for the entire 5 years. 

Ask yourself as an INVESTOR, not as a gamer or an AMD customer, what upside does this company have in the future? I like AMD as a company but as an investor I can’t reasonably invest in it as it seems to have 10 years of growth already priced into the company. It’s a fantastic company but unless you bought low (as in before the recent 6 months of run up) what exactly are you expecting the stock to do?
3. I wanted to buy when it was $50. People looked at me with blank stares when I spoke highly of AMD and it’s now at $83.

I say go for it. Even if It doesn’t grow, you won’t be losing any of it. Better than sticking your money in some shitty savings account.

iui7gy,stocks,"Post: AMD about to test 50 day MA

The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.

If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.

The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.

But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.

The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was. Any additional insight from anyone would be great!

I am very tempted to average down my position with AMD. Also loooong on TSMC.

I've been very silly with AMD in the past. Trained my paper hands though. I'm never selling now!

Bought in at $30, sold at $42. Then bought again at $77, sold at $90. Then bought again at $87, and currently still holding.

Based on the news from the Fed on interest, and Trump's stimulus talks recently, there's strong chance that we are in the bottom of the bear trap.

3.  Never doubt su bae buy buy buy
4. My 9/25 calls are all set to die. Big loss.
5. I've said it before and I'll say it again: why does anyone think AMD is a priced fairly at 40% the market cap of INTC, when AMD profited just $716M in the last 12 months vs Intel's $26B. It literally makes no sense. And I don't want to hear ""it's a growth story."" Yes, that's true, but it's also all baked in by this point if that's the case. If you're buying into AMD at this level, you're basically saying to yourself that you expect AMD to grow profits by 14x from $700M to $10B just to match Intel on a comparable basis. And then the price would be fair and you'd have no logical upside. That's a massive ""What If"". Either Intel's profit is somehow less valuable, or AMD is vastly overpriced. 

Don't get me wrong, I love AMD as a company and the products they produce. I have an AMD processor as part of my last upgrade. But the stock has gotten out of control.

Top Comments:
1. It seems that AMD will keep growing a bit because it is eating the crumbs left by Nvidia.
2. Big companies are not dumb. They don’t want to have nvidia monopolise the industry, so they will buy tons from amd. And it’s not like amds offering are subpar, they are on the same level as nvidia. Nvidia will not really grow much, now’s the time for AMD.
3. AMD will be fine. I believe their stock has a path to doubling within 5 years (I am being conservative as I believe it’ll likely happen within 3 years). Their data centre business is brand new and went from $0 to $5b annual in one year. The TAM will increase 4x by 2027. Even if AMD maintains its 4% or so market share it’ll see its data centre revenues increase to $20b annually (which is about what the entire company makes annually). Data centre margins are quite high (53.5% or so). 

Realistically, AMD’s market share will grow so we’re likely looking at least $30b in annual GPU revenue in the coming years. 

I still believe Nvidia will be the better performer since their sales and margins are much higher, however AMD will probably undercut their margins by competing on price. I would own both and Broadcom since the hyperscalers will continue to spend big on this.
4. Regardless of whether you consider AMD as an AI chip provider or not, the fact of the matter is, AMD is an ai chip provider.
5. Once AMD Threadripper came out, I considered AMD a leader in multi-core CPUs. Maybe you would like them if you watched that segment of their activities.

Below are some professions where multi-core CPUs have power. And naturally, people who multi-task on their computers want all the ""brains"" they can get working at once.

In short, 1) Intel can’t get any of their new processes to yield 2). they’ve executed extremely poorly on product for the past 10 years even while dropping half the products on their roadmaps and 3) AMDs architecture with TSMC process is by far more performant per watt compared to Intels brute force power utilization.

tybpmi,stocks,"Post: Drop NVDA or AMD?

I'm looking to pick up some AAPL and in an effort to avoid my portfolio becoming too tech heavy I want to drop NVDA or AMD. Has anyone got any arguments they feel would justify dropping one over another?

*Edit* Some people are confused by my wording; what I mean is if I held Apple, Nvidia and AMD my portfolio would be too tech heavy so I was asking which of them people think I should get rid of.

Top Comments:
1. Nobody tell him
2. I would hold both and continue to buy aapl over the next year. Market will continue to drop and give you a good entry. NVDA is the biggest part of my portfolio and I plan to keep it that way. AMD promising as well. I don’t see anything wrong with a tech heavy portfolio as tech is the future. Just continue to diversify over time - no need to sell and pay tax especially if you haven’t held for a year and will pay capital taxes.
3. You want to buy apple in order to avoid a tech heavy portfolio?…
4. You should read The Systemic Undervaluation of Big Tech by Nayut Sitachitt. Dropping NVDA and AMD for the sake of “diversification” is foolish and is a sentiment that is wrongfully echoed. Big tech is literally the future, and those two companies are strong companies worth betting on. If you’re starving for dividends or other sectors, simply add those positions.
5. Unfortunately, the Appell Petroleum Corporation, ticker symbol appl was delisted in 2016. Might I suggest Apple, ticker symbol aapl, instead?",07-04-2022 12:12

If you aren’t 10 years or less from retirement, you should be excited about the upcoming potential recession or market correction. These happen from time to time and historically speaking, every recession is a perfect time to get a decent position in whatever your favorite Blue chip companies are(that is of course if during the recession you have any spare money to begin with). Companies like Apple and Microsoft are recession proof and these current prices are at a great discount.

otv8dv,stocks,"Post: I’m up over 20% on AMD. Would you sell?

Update below

I bought the AMD dip into my longterm portfolio (tax free) and since then I am up a lot. Is it realistic to expect AMD to keep going up for the rest of the year or can I sell now and buy back in later for less? 

Position: 8 shares

EDIT:

Update: Thank you everyone who replied. I got a lot of good advice and interesting perspectives. Nearly all were helpful or at least good natured. Here’s some of the recommendations I received: 

- Hold and buy dips because fundamentals and leadership suggest AMD will only keep going up 

- Sell and reallocate to a position that I have more confidence in

- Sell all and put in ETFs / Index funds for long term steady growth 

- Sell part and keep the rest - sell a % or take back my initial deposit so I am not sweating it, playing with free money

- Sell all and buy LEAPS

- Open a position with a plan so I don’t have to ask people on the internet what to do with my money.

I decided to sell 2 of my shares so I have some cash on hand. I have maxed out my tax advantage account for the year so the $200 might help if a high conviction play takes a hit. I am ready to put more into AMD if the price drops. Maybe I will even buy calls in my trading account. 

By far my biggest take away is that people have a lot of faith in AMD with Su at the helm. Thanks again everyone for your insight and your patience with a relatively inexperienced / nervous investor

1. It doesn't matter if you're up 1% or 20%. It doesn't matter what company it is. The answer is always the same: you sell if you've found a better allocation for your money.
2. I'm up 570% on AMD. 

I don't sell great companies.
3. Nope, I have been holding AMD since $2.50/share - extremely well run company and with Xilinx merger - it is a long-term holding.
4. Don't sell unless you need the money or something fundamentally changes in the company - so keep it for few years

1. All 3 are worth owning. I've been averaging up in AMD the past month and am getting closer to starting a position in ARM.  Don't try to time it or you'll drive yourself crazy -- just buy some here. If it goes down buy some more.

10qb2lq,stocks,"Post: AMD Earnings - beats on sales and profit but warns of a 10% revenue decline in Q1

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/amd-earnings-q4-2022.html

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ending in December:

EPS: $0.69, adjusted, versus $0.67 per share expected

Revenue: $5.6 billion, versus $5.5 billion expected


AMD said it expected $5.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, slightly lower than a Refinitiv estimate of $5.47 billion. AMD’s estimate suggests a 10% decline in sales in the current quarter. It also said it expected its adjusted gross margin to be about 50%, a key metric for chipmakers like AMD.

AMD reported earnings as many of its rival chipmakers have stumbled in recent weeks, citing lower consumer demand for finished electronics and gluts of parts needed to make PCs and servers. Intel, AMD’s primary competitor, reported a disastrous quarter last week that included a weak 2023 outlook.

While AMD said it saw slow sales for its PC chips and graphics processors, it said its data center segment rose 42% year-over-year, suggesting it took market share from Intel.

AMD attributed its beat to strong growth in its embedded and data center businesses, and said that its client revenue, or chips for PCs and laptops, and its gaming segment were down.

AMD’s data center segment rose 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Its embedded segment grew 1,868%, AMD said, because of sales from its purchase of Xilinx.

AMD’s gaming business, which is comprised of graphics cards and chips for gaming consoles, was down 7% year-over-year. The decrease came from graphics cards and was offset by “semi-custom” revenue, which is what the company calls its chips for systems like the PlayStation 5.

Top Comments:
1. AMD inching closer to INTC every quarter.
2. INTC on Q4 2022 reported $14B in revenue and guides $10.5-11.5B in Q1 2023 compared to AMD's $5.6B and $5.3B guidance. That means AMD earned 37% of INTC's revenue in Q4 and expects to earn 50% of INTC's revenue in Q1 2023.

INTC's revenue was -28.2% Y/Y in Q4 while AMDs was up 16% Y/Y in Q4.

INTC's guidance is for $10.5-11.5B in Q1 2023, which is -40% Y/Y compared to its Q1 2022 figure of $18B. AMD's guidance is for $5.3B compared to its Q1 2022 figure of $5.89B, which is -10% Y/Y.

INTC saw Q4 gross margin of 39% and AMD saw 43%. INTC expects Q1 2023 gross margins to fall to 34%. AMD expects 50%.

AMD’s data center segment rose 42% Y/Y to $1.7 billion. INTC saw a -33% change Y/Y in Q4. Clearly that's market share being stolen.

~~AMD saw free cash flow of $3.1 billion compared to $3.2 billion one year prior. INTC also saw free cash flows of $3.1 billion in Q4.~~ Someone fact check me here. I'm getting conflicting results.

INTC is a 115B market cap company, AMD is now 116B.

Edit: I'm adding more data as I can find it. Or share it and I'll update the table below.

Edit 2: **Corrected FCF**: AMD's quarterly FCF was 443M. Intel's was 2B. AMD's annual FCF was 3.1B. Intel's was -9.6B. Apologies! (This means the Q4 comparison looks better for INTC but much worse annually)
3. Pretty good all considered. I'm surprised to see them beat earnings with the current PC market
4. AMD has a lot of room to grow and Intel to help it, could see it get back to an ATH in a few quarters
5. Note from the call:

They expect cloud growth to be *negative double digits* next quarter because they’re slogging through inventory. So much for data center growth. Note that the data center revenue growth is huge YoY because of a good year last year, but has almost flatlined QoQ. Now we are dipping into negative growth territory

No full year guidance given

Said margins would improve but no hard numbers given when asked

In fact the entire call was just sidestepping questions about hard numbers when asked and making general non-data statements in reply. A couple analysts seemed very frustrated at that. Stacy Rasgon had to ask his question twice and still got no answer. The BoA analyst was perplexed how they could be working through inventory when shipments were down so much and got a weak answer. Could feel the frustration all around

On a positive note, the Xilinx piece seems to be doing well

But overall that was not a good earnings phone call, I am surprised that it has held up AH. It is very apparent that full year is not pretty.",31-01-2023 21:29

jn7ej3,stocks,"Post: AMD is a steal at $75

\[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link\]

I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.

&#x200B;

So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:

&#x200B;

[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)

First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.

&#x200B;

**35B Xilinx Takeover**

Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:

[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)

[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)

Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits.

&#x200B;

**New GPU Reveal**

Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**

This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO

**RISK**

Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.

&#x200B;

Positions:

AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.

Top Comments:
1. If AMD is a steal at $75, what was it when it was $2? A robbery?
2. Valid points. I think the biggest risk though is the current valuation. Even if Amd continues to grow at 50% yoy, there’s not much money to be made in the mid/long term when you assume that stocks tend to return to a valuation of 20-25, maybe 30-35 in this low-interest-rate environment. Doesn’t this basically mean that Amd, if it continues this growth rate, should have the same valuation in 3-5 years that it has now? 

Also, iirc Amd has given out lots of shares over the last years which also will be a pressure on stock price of continued.
3. I’m just here to mention that Intel has more cash on hand, then AMD made in revenue in the last 5 years, and that Intel grew their revenue Q2 2019 to Q2 2020 more then 3 times more then AMD did 1b vs 3.2b.

Might want to mention that in the risk section. 

AMD is in my opinion not a safe bet at this price. I’m not saying if this is a right or wrong investment for people.
I’m not trying to sway anyone from investing in AMD, so I won’t bother you with an extensive analysis of the risk associated with AMD, but please do your own research to understand the risk of investing in such a generously valued company.

I like NVDA because it is the big boy, it has bigger market share and has further progressed into AI which could be a big deal in the next decade.

AMD however has better financial and seems like the better priced stock with bigger upside potential.

What are your thoughts? Any advice?

2. Personally I would invest in both. You’re not obligated to be loyal to a single company and it’s impossible to know which will perform better in the future. However it is likely both will see significant growth in the future.
3. I divided the amount of money I put into the sector between them. They are complementary holdings and I have a lot of respect for both of their CEOs so I just bought equal amounts of both.
4. AMD's current server products are expected to continue gaining market share from Intel, which drove their price to 160 last year. While the product they just announced at CES has a good chance of taking market share from nVidia. It integrates top of the line CPUs with GPUs almost as good as nVidia's in one excellent product with huge memory bandwidth. 

AMD is also a lot cheaper than nVidia right now.
5. Nvidia is currently insanely overvalued and they are probably in a similar situation like Microsoft during the dotcom bubble. Their earnings are down, yet valuations are still very high. The company's products are great, but not the stock price.",09-01-2023 19:39
jhryzy,stocks,"Post: With AMD reporting earnings on Tuesday, and Intel dropping last week, how is Monday into Tuesday going to play out?

Either AMD will follow intel and under perform or, and much more likely, AMD earnings will way over perform.

I would think that that the losses from intel had to go somewhere and that somewhere will be AMD. 

I’m expecting $83 to $85 on Monday and then low to mid $90s on Tuesday after announcements. 

Thank you

mceprg,stocks,"Post: It's not just me right?

For the past month I've been getting absolutely crushed little by little each day it seems like in every sector.  I feel like I have a pretty well diversified portfolio.  I'm not really heavy on any one particular stock out of the ones below, so I'm not even sure where the majority of the losses are coming from.  I'm still green on most everything but I've given back a lot of gains, these definitely aren't all my investments but a majority of the bigger positions.    
Tech/Growth:  AAPL, GOOG, PLTR, TSLA, AMZN, AMD, UBER, BABA, JD etc. \~35%  
Travel/Rebound (cyclical):  UAL, AAL, OXY, MGM, MAR, NCLH, TRIP, ABNB \~30%  
Financials: WFC, BCS, JPM, BAC\~10%  
Retail stocks for stimulus check play:  UAA, NKE, M, LULU, etc.  \~10%  
Other positions making up less than 15%   


Somehow I've lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month, it doesn't feel like it but every day it goes down 1 or 2% and that starts to add up.  I know I know, in 5 years who cares but I just wanted to know if other people seem to be in the same boat.  I haven't seen the main indexes see that kind of loss so I'm not getting where it seems to be coming from.  Even today when all looked great in the morning now somehow I'm deep red again (another 2%) despite indexes being mostly stable.

I tried recalibrating my portfolio and reduced my tech exposure and increased my oil/travel names and still got hit pretty hard. I’m not sure what to do at this point to stop the bleeding. SPY puts won’t work because oddly enough, SPY seems to be up a lot of the time.
4. I feel exactly the same. Get even more frustrated when I read that the S&P and Dow are still close to their all time highes and Nasdaq only lost 7% compared to the top in Februari. Meanwhile mine portfolio is down 21%.

AMD today announced revenue for the first quarter of 2024 of $5.5 billion, gross margin of 47%, operating income of $36 million, net income of $123 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.07. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 52%, operating income was $1.1 billion, net income was $1.0 billion and diluted earnings per share was $0.62.

“We delivered strong first quarter results with our Data Center and Client segments each growing more than 80% year-over-year driven by the ramp of MI300 AI accelerator shipments and the adoption of our Ryzen and EPYC processors,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. We are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio.”

“AMD started the year strong, delivering record quarterly Data Center segment revenue,” said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu. “In addition, we drove solid gross margin expansion. Moving forward, we are well positioned to continue driving revenue growth and margin improvement while investing in the large AI opportunities ahead.”

1. Intel will be showing their Lunar Lake processor for  laptops and mobile June 7th.
2. Overblown. Everyone is hyping up ARM as if it's new tech. It isn't. Microsoft has already tried the ARM in windows thing, and consumers didn't like that 70% of applications simply refused to run on it. Want to run this steam game from 2013? Good luck. Need to install a niece program for a work or class assignment? Unless the person running that has a new release that supports ARM, you're out of luck. Simply put, there have been a ton of ""x86"" killers released for decades, and none of them succeed, because when so much of modern computing is built on x86, it doesn't make a lot of sense to shift away from it. The only reason why Apple and Qualcomm are even using ARM is because it is open for use, while x86 and x86-64 aren't. There is literally no reason why you should use an ARM chip over an x86 in a laptop or desktop. 

It should also be noted that ARM is not just one architecture, it's a dozen, all requiring different programs and tooling. x86 is also not fundamentally more power sucking, as tuning the clock down(servers and laptops do this already) can significantly reduce the power draw. The only reason ARM succeeded in mobile is because Intel fumbled, Qualcomm and Co. succeeded, and the feedback loop that followed meant there was basically no entry room for x86.
3. AMD just because
4. First of all, what Qualcomm has done is really amazing and should not be discounted. Day one support from major OEMs takes a lot of work.

Now on to some misconceptions

1. ARM vs x86 debate is stupid. A good design is more important than any ISA (ARM/x86/RISC-V). There are no technical limitations for x86 to match ARM’s designs efficiency.

2. No one moves laptop chip volumes like Intel. Plus, Intel has helped design so many PC models and have so many relationships with OEMs which is hard to break in an instant.

3. Intel/AMD have caught up to Windows on ARM efficiency that you’ll see in Computex 2024. 

4. Microsoft is not acknowledging the real problem behind poor efficiency. It’s the part Windows. Windows doesn’t idle well and hence, even a more efficient chip than Apple M series can’t beat Apple MacOS + M Series
5. Intels price dropped and they still have higher pe than Qualcomm after 30% price increase recently",22-05-2024 23:38

Mortgage interest rates are so high for some people that they need to make 10+% profit in stocks a year to justify holding stocks instead of paying off the debt. That means less than 10% profit is a loss for those people. The question is how likely 10% or higher return is.

This is based on my personal situation. Holding NVDA and AMD.

1. S&P yield is about to be surpassed by the 10Y yield (risk free rate), so perhaps the better question to ask is, how likely is it that SP500, NVDA, AMD etc. have negative returns over the next 12 months.

This meme stock explosion has made me even more tight and Scrooge-like with my money. I have most of money sitting in blue chip stocks like DIS & HSBC amongst many others with a small amount for playing, doing my own DD on and hoping for a 3x but settling for a small profit or loss in most cases. 

I love reading other people’s DD, always have, and it’s great to have a community that helps you cut down a bit of the work (even though you must follow up with your own reading) in potentially spotting something that could be big. However, there has been a massive spike recently of people that finish they DD with ‘this could be the next GME’ or something similar and as soon as I read that, I am instantly put off. 

Everything they have said up to that point gets a little tainted for me. 

I know this is completely irrational and actually a bit stupid on my part but I equate it to a restaurant that has ‘The Best (insert food item)‘ or ‘World Famous blah blah’ on their menu. It puts me off instantly. 

Anyone else feel like this? Or am I just being snooty?

1. Based on the upvotes, this post could be the next GME.
2. It means that they actually haven’t done an DD if they are referring it as GME. GME is a unique situation where shooters were caught over shorting and retail investors were shown how HF can be caught with their hand in a cookie jar. Extremely unique situation. 

Soon as people start comparing to GME you know it’s bullshit. They’re hoping your greedy lizard brain overpowers your logical brain and you FOMO in.

The AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer is now the first officially recognized exascale supercomputer in the world, topping 1.102 ExaFlop/s during a sustained Linpack run. That ranks first on the newly-released Top500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers as the number of AMD-powered systems on the list has expanded significantly this year. Frontier not only overtakes the previous leader, Japan's Fugaku, but blows it out of the water — in fact, Frontier is faster than the next seven supercomputers on the list, combined. Notably, while Frontier hit 1.1 ExaFlops during a sustained Linpack FP64 benchmark, the system delivers up to 1.69 ExaFlops in peak performance but has headroom to hit 2 ExaFlops after more tuning. For reference, one ExaFlop equals one quintillion floating point operations per second.

1. Can it run crysis
2. Yep, that supercomputer is blazing fast but this is r/stocks. AMD has gained a lot of market in supercomputers last and this year. According to article AMD now populates 5 spots in top ten, 94 in top 500. November 2021 it was 73, June 2021 it was 49 in top 500. I don't know how big supercomputer market is compared to consumer or normal server markets.

Processors used in this supercomputer are modified normal processors. Which means price is high, I'd suspect profit is high also. This supercomputer uses 9408 processors. Supercomputers also use GPU's (GPU is heart of graphic card) for different kind of calculations. This supercomputer uses special GPU's which are AMD's latest release, not to be found from local stores.  Around 38k GPU's was used to build this.

Cost of processors and GPU's is just one part of cost of supercomputer, don't know how large. Still number of GPU's used suggest that AMD's part of price wasn't low. Also good news for their new GPU release.

 Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/amd-earnings-q3-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/amd-earnings-q3-2022.html)

[Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/) shares were volatile in extended trading on Tuesday after the chipmaker announced fiscal third-quarter results and quarterly guidance that failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings:** 67 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 68 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $5.57 billion, vs. $5.62 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Overall, AMD’s revenue grew by 29% year over year in the quarter that ended on Sept. 24, according to a [statement](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1098/amd-reports-third-quarter-2022-financial-results). Net income fell 93% to $66 million, mainly because of AMD’s $49 billion acquisition in February of Xilinx, a maker of chips called field-programmable gate arrays.

On Oct. 6, AMD [issued preliminary results](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/amd-warns-of-third-quarter-revenue-shortfall-on-weaker-pc-demand-supply-chain-issues.html) for the fiscal third quarter that lagged guidance it [provided in August](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/amd-earnings-q2-2022.html), given fewer chip shipments because of a weaker PC market than expected. The stock fell almost 14% in its largest decline in a single trading session since March 2020.

During the quarter AMD [announced](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1089/amdlaunches-ryzen-7000-series-desktop-processors-with) Ryzen 7000 desktop PC chips for playing video games.

With respect to guidance, AMD said it sees $23.50 billion in full-year revenue, down from the $26.3 billion forecast the company gave in August. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $23.88 billion. The company contracted its adjusted gross margin outlook to 52% from 54% in August.

AMD said its Data Center segment generated $1.61 billion in revenue in the fiscal third quarter, up 45% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $1.64 billion. The unit includes contributions from Xilinx and distributed computing startup Pensando, which cost AMD $1.9 billion in an acquisition completed in May.

The Gaming segment produced $1.63 billion in revenue. That was up about 14% and in line with the $1.63 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

The Embedded segment that includes some Xilinx sales delivered $1.30 billion, up from $79 million in the year-ago quarter and in line with the $1.30 billion StreetAccount consensus.

AMD’s Client unit, which the chipmaker had warned about in October, came up with $1.02 billion in revenue. That was down nearly 40% but in excess of the $1.17 billion StreetAccount consensus. Four days after AMD gave preliminary results, technology industry researcher Gartner [said](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-10-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-19-percent-in-third-quarter-of-2022) third-quarter PC shipments fell 19.5%, the steepest decline the company has seen since it started following the market in the mid-1990s.

All four of the segments delivered slightly more revenue than AMD had said to expect in its October warning.

Notwithstanding the after-hours fluctuation, AMD stock has slipped 58% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is down 19% over the same period.

Executives will discuss the results with analysts on a conference call starting at 5 p.m. ET.

I'm still looking for a place to park some cash. I thought I narrowed it down to AMD. I like it fundamentally and it has strong technicals.

But, I've been relooking at PLTR and wonder if anyone has any opinions of the two.

I'm not looking for a specific sector play - the two companies each present some strong cases, but AMD has a more proven upside, less down side risk.

PLTR is a more aggressive play with an unknown downside risk. It hasn't really shown much strength to me yet and can't seem to break out. Does anyone have bearish attitude to PLTR and would like to explain why?

Hi,

I'm interested in buying stock for NVIDIA, AMD and Intel but I'm pretty new with short term investments but I've been keeping an eye out for the companies and what they do.   
However. I am not sure when it's interesting to invest in the stock of these companies. (presumably any time they are going to make an announcement seems interesting).  
When would be the best times to invest in these stocks according to you, the community?

Top Comments:
1. About a year ago when Nvda was at $114
2. the risky way is when they are significantly down. 

the rich way is when they are up and climbing. 

the retail way is when they are all time high.
3. Just look on Reddit, once the consensus is that the company is dead, has no chance and will go under, it's usually the time to buy... With Intel that was some month back when it was at $27 and cut it's dividend, that's when I bought it...
4. Well I think you should start by learning financial reports, P/E ratios and such. Then compare the stocks and make up your own mind.

My 2 cents is I'd say big US tech is overvalued right now due to AI hype. Even if it isn't massively overvalued, a correction is due. All I know for sure is when the markets are moving up or down at rapid pace is when I decide to stay out of it and just hold. There are quite specific times to sell and times to buy, but holding is always a good idea if the underlying company is able to turn a profit and has cash to burn through in case of an economic emergency. Interest rates are high so companies with not a lot of cash and big amounts of debt + high operating costs would be something I'd stay away from right now.

There's an endless amount of counter arguments you could make though, so I'd recommend you learn at least the financial reports and then see what views you come up with yourself. Always nicer to invest when you know at least a little bit about whats going on.

1. I just don’t get why it tanked today. In any case I just bought more stock.
2. Sub $100 AMD represents serious value long-term imo.

Anything short term right now is risky and you could see further drops in share price. 

Act accordingly.
3. It's down 53% from its ATH. Down 46% YTD. It's a very solid company that provides products that will be in high demand over the next decade and beyond. I bought in today when it went down to $76.60 and plan on slowly buying more over the next 6-9 months. It will be a guessing game what it does during this stretch, but it's a safe assumption that it will not be getting near its previous ATH anytime soon. Heck even getting back to say $120 seems like a stretch in the short-term. I view it as a good long-term hold, so I am fine with waiting a bit to start seeing some good returns. If it continues to dip, and it may very well do this, I will continue to buy more and lower my cost basis.
4. Fantastic leadership, industry-best technology, and the demand for semiconductors is going to 10x over the next decade.

But if you’re talking about short term you might as well throw darts at a board.

Intel Reaffirms: Our Discrete GPUs Will Be On Shelves in Q1 2022

>there’s one little tidbit in the earnings presentation about its upcoming new discrete GPU offerings. The earnings are usually a chance to wave the flag of innovation about what’s to come, and this time around Intel is confirming that its first-generation discrete graphics with the Xe-HPG architecture will be on shelves in Q1 2022.

>The fundamental building block of Alchemist is the Xe Core. For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC’s N6 process to do it. Given Intel’s Q1’22 release timeframe, Intel’s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD’s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA’s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there’s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC’s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they’ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP. Note that this is the sum total of all of their improvements – process, logic, circuit, and architecture – so it’s not clear how much of this comes from the jump to TSMC N6 from Intel 10SF, and how much comes from other optimizations.

>The Q1 launch window puts CES (held the first week of January) as a good spot to say something more.

1. >""No new information""

They just revealed earnings after market close yesterday, indicating their revenue is down due to supply shortages, and lots of capex is expected.

Their capital expenditures will put pressure on their dividend, as even if they maintain solid earnings, those earnings are going right into investing in new fabs. Those may take several years to pay off, so there are short term price risks if investors sell off due to a dividend cut/suspension.

I bought a lot of shares today due to the dip, I think they're a good value buy, but it's certainly not ""no new information"".

Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

The earning season really shows how strong Apple is toward consumer. Apple has been historically seen as a phone company, but it is now building its own “privacy complaint” ad platform, running its own TV shows, doing chip design, CarPlay OS, it’s firing all cylinders in entertainment, device, fitness, and now credit card and finances, primarily due to its proprietary control of the operating system. 

With the declining Android/PC sales but increasing iPhone/mac sales, it’s just a matter of time the grip Apple has over other consumer big / medium tech grows as Apple pursue complete domination of operating systems adoption through the world. Sure Apple doesn’t offer enterprise and cloud compute yet, but if we just focus on consumer, you can’t really long both Apple and its competitors can’t you? Meaning, if you are buying META you are basically betting against AAPL, so on and so forth..

AMD has been on a crazy hot streak the last few years, outperforming the market by many multiples, outperforming its peers (INTL, NVDA) and outperforming just about every other stock except for a few giants. 

This stock is super frothy at this point, right? Granted that it still makes good products, but I don't know how the ~500 PE can be justified when NVDA is ~220 and INTL is ~negative. 

Or do people not care about PE anymore and just believe that AMD will continue grow its revenue amidst the AI tsunami?

You can’t just look at PE alone and make these comparisons, looking at other comparisons AMD is still way cheaper than NVDA. Both are probably overpriced though, but who knows if there is more room to grow and the actual future demand is still unknown.

NVDA is going to be growing its profits at an extreme rate in the next 30 years and is financing that growth purely through profits not debt or equity. Their management is also top notch and very savy in international business as well as technology

AMD just has one of the best CEOs currently in that role and is taking giant bites out of intel and Samsung.

- increasing margins without all the capex

- Run at the Data Center till 2025

- Xilinx opening up communication 

- cpu,gpu and fgpa on the same die is a possibility now. 

- intel betting all on fabs , an area whete they have been having trouble. Risky strategy .

it7nbn,stocks,"Post: Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC

 This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/microsoft-raises-price-of-xbox-live-gold-by-1-a-month-1846108641/amp

Microsoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be.

To this day, Xbox remains the only console that requires an Xbox Live membership to play free-to-play games, including games such as Warzone.

PC gaming was already on the rise, I ditched my Xbox last year to build a PC of my own, but this imo would catalyze the migration off console towards PC gaming even further. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: So I’m editing this as of 1/23 to add that Microsoft has done a complete 180 and decided no membership will be needed to play free to play games, and no price hike on Xbox Live either! I was almost shocked they flipped on this so quickly lol. Thanks for everyone’s inputs!

wrx7zi,stocks,"Post: I think I have learned my lesson

During high school. I invested in tech stocks such as NIO, TSM and AMD. I did this with no margin and ended up with 100% return through the covid years. This gave me confidence to be more bold with my investments. After graduating I decided to dedicate more time to learn about stocks. I still stuck with 0% margins and still followed my standard procedure when doing due diligence. I evaluated a company’s balance sheets, determined whether a company is undervalued or overvalued as I moved away from tech stocks and allowed myself to dip into other industries. I believe I had became pretty good at it. I invested in companies like AUPH at $11 and cashed out most of my stocks at ~$25. I bought into NET at $50 which Im still holding and still green on. However, recently BBBY soared up to the 20s. I read what the redditors over at WSB were saying and decided to throw in 15% of my equity into a position at X5 margins into BBBY. Today, the stock has dipped so much that I believe I am going to have to pay off my BBBY position with other positions in my portfolio.

1g090wb,stocks,"Post: AMD AI event on Oct 10: Any expectations?

I haven't seen any update about AMD able to improve their supply issues to improve MI300 cards, nor do I see wide adoption. A few months ago couple ""AI Datacenter"" startups shared stage with AMD about their new offerings with MI300 but some of them have quietly embraced NVDA and abandoned AMD due to poor supply.

No good news which highlights how META uses these cards and any performance benefits in training or inference on MI300. Azure and OCI clouds have some regions with few MI300 compute instances but I have not seen any customer success stories using these vs using Nvidia older generation T4, A100 and H100s. 

State of ROCm is not bad. It's improving and many have written blogs and KB articles on how Llama3 models are running without issues on MI300 cards. I read some articles of using Mistral as well. However, AMD still isn't able to demonstrate end to end solutions.

Who feels optimistic about AMD and they able to grab at least 5% of AI market in next 2 to 3 years at this snail pace? What are you expecting from tomorrow's AMD AI event?

What, if any, are the grown prospects for AMD in AI era with limited supplies for MI cards?

Top Comments:
1. Time is on AMD's side when it comes to ROCm. CUDA has more compatibility due to its age and support, which means everyone goes to Nvidia for GPGPU compute. 

I've written some CUDA code for roughly a decade, but I'm new to ROCm and see potential in it, despite it having confusing hardware support and bad documentation. One example is no support for integrated GPUs like the 780M, which AMD should add so developers can actually experiment with ROCm. Then there's the IPUs/NPUs (whatever they're calling them this week) bundled with the newer CPUs, which seldom have support and are borderline wastes of silicon so far. 

It's a rough start, but I'm certain it will improve as the years go by.
2. It plays out similar to their consumer gpu market. Nvidia is always ahead of the curve and innovating, and AMD are usually playing catch up with an inferior but still decent product. Expect Nvidia to dominate AI with constantly fresh ideas and innovations. I'm in both but more weighted towards Nvidia, definitely some money to be made by both but AMD will be a slower burn.
3. 5% should be no problem, yet the gap with Blackwell / CUDA seems huge.
4. I honestly don't know very much about the AI generation. I mean, I'm an engineer, I know more than a layman, but I won't pretend to be an expert

that said, both Nvidia and AMD have always sincerely impressed me, to the point where I have exclusively always run those two together (even despite their previous incompatibilities and audio stuttering issues via PCM, which I was constantly fixing)

I am an NVDA holder because they \*always\* seem to find a way to make themselves the center of the conversation, to make ""aspirational"" parts.

I am an AMD lover because they always managed to hold their own against Intel at a fraction of the price. every single time someone said they were dead, they'd come out with something like Phenom II or Ryzen that blew everyone away

essentially, I'll set aside the balance sheet due diligence, as you'll no doubt do that separately...but that ""it factor"" people look for in addition to a solid 10K? AMD has it in its tenacity and unwillingness to give up.

I wouldn't be surprised at \*all\* to see AMD capture a share of the AI market....but remember, even with all Intels massive mistakes, they never managed to \*corner\* the market, so I also wouldn't expect them to have a massive takeover. 

maybe that suggests a small position is logical if the balance sheet looks right?
5. These events don't mean much.


As your post is in r/stocks, I believe your question is more about the stock price. Q3 earnings call - where each number in the balance sheet is vetted by auditors, and CxOs are personally liable for any omission/ misrepresentation, have much more effect on the stock, than anything else. Q3 earnings from others in the semi-gang would also boost the overall sentiment for the sector. So I'd pay more attention to those dates.",10-10-2024 02:40

1. >Can Intel actually collapse with so much market share superiority? 

Collapse? I doubt it. Drop another 50%? Sure.

""they won't go bankrupt"" has never been a good argument for a stock outside of deep value plays. Why do I see it for S&P 500 companies all the time? Nokia didn't collapse but that doesn't make it a good investment in 2010.
2. Intel isn't just ""not going anywhere"" they are actively *declining* OP. Sales are going down and their attempts at a new generation of CPUs have gone from bad to outright failure. This means *future prospects* are looking rightfully dim...




Also consumer CPUs is a miniscule market. The big thing is data centers where Intel used to dominate but now AMD is slowly but surely eating their lunch. AMD also has the whole freaking console market locked down. AMD is growing strongly in every COU sector and Intel is bleeding, they are looking more and more like a *zombie company* by the day. Rotting from the head and down...



So no, OP. Being a former gigant is not enough to be bullish, Nokia used to dominate the global phone market so much their old marketshare was as if you combined Apple and Samsung both! Yet they fell out of favour due to poor leadership and went from globally dominant to penny stock. I'm not saying Intel is dead, but there is litterary no reason to be bullish. For the foreseeable future Intel will only continue to shrink and lose revenue. They need good CPUs desperately to get back and that isn't even a thing they can do right now. That's a major problem.

n4e3w6,stocks,"Post: Why is NVDA worth so much more than AMD?

I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated.

Top Comments:
1. Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:

Revenue:

NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)

Gross Profit:

NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)

Income Before Taxes:

NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).

Net Income:

NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).

So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.
2. AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD.
3. Look at net income.

553m vs 1.46b

Profit = Revenue - Expenses
4. As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.

That said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult.
5. Simply said look at their businesses as well. Speculate forward.

What is next for AMD, producing a better chip ? Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.

What is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?

'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''

Looks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.

Which company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.

mauium,stocks,"Post: Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**
   * **DataDog - $DDOG - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Ai**
   * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD**
   * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD**
   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

13qwxsw,stocks,"Post: NVIDIA beat earnings, top expectations.

Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.

Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected

Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected

Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected

Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected

Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.

“The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

2. Whole semi conductor sector suffers a lot,there are non sense news and analysis' that the chip demand will weaken. amd has the same faith,when you see soxx index start to reverse the stock will gain nice momentum .These are days funds try to drop prices with stupid articles so they can buy bottom prices
3. I can't say I understand Xilinx much more than what AMD is letting on - i.e. gives access to the 5G and vehicle markets, as well as Xilinx having strong AI inference capability over Nvidia. Also best practices for AI will change over time, so Xilinx's programmability may allow units to adapt to new practices without designing new chips, also allows for prototyping faster during these changes.

In terms of Pensando, my understanding is that it allows AMD to flesh out their network offerings to compete with Nvidia's Bluefield and Intel's IPU. How important is the tech that allows Pensando to offer something that is 5-10x better than AWS Nitro, I don't know or understand.

What I do feel strongly about is that AMD has now recruited people that are the top of their fields in terms of leadership, innovation and expertise - Victor Peng from Xilinx, MPLS team from Cisco. I don't really know who David Wong is (not that I know any of them personally, haha), but I guess we'll see how RDNA3 turns out.

The people who run and direct the organizations are really important. You can have talented and smart engineers but if they aren't motivated or allowed to blossom, then the whole company will go down the drain. It's pretty important to understand that it's the employees that do the engineering, but the direction and guidance and direction set by strong and experienced leadership is equally important.

I bought some shares at 100. Usually when I buy, the stock drops. So you guys can thank me for price drop. I'll buy some more when it's 90, so it'll probably drop even more. You're welcome.

16munt4,stocks,"Post: How Competitive will AMD be against Nvidia in AI Accelerator Market

I've been delving into the specifics of AMD's New MI 300 platform and it appears to stack up favorably against the H100, often surpassing it in several aspects. However, there's an ongoing discussion about ROCm lagging behind CUDA, though AMD is vigorously working to bridge this software gap. Despite not being a semiconductor novice, I find myself drawn to AMD's chiplet-based design over Nvidia's monolithic approach. As we move toward smaller die sizes with High NA EUV, expertise in chiplet-based design will prove crucial, yielding numerous advantages. Additionally, AMD's ability to integrate different process nodes within the same package adds to cost efficiency.  
  
This discussion is pertinent due to the striking disparity in revenue estimates between AMD and Nvidia. The projections suggest Nvidia might achieve over six times the Accelerator revenue in 2027. It's worth noting that the actual figure could be even higher, considering that Data Center revenue encompasses enterprise CPU sales as well. Does anyone have any thoughts?

Top Comments:
1. As you mentioned, the biggest issue is software, as it always has been for ML. I don't know if it's just as easy as making decent software. There's an ecosystem and switching costs. If your company is making a lot of money and spending a lot of money on developers, it's hard to justify using up dev time and increasing risk to switch.

What could change this is a differentiated product, but I am not sure what that looks like.
2. Nvidia is a generation ahead of AMD in most of their applications. And Nvidia doesnt seem to slow down with their software Innovations. So unless AMD has a Magic trick in their pocket I doubt that they will overtake Nvidia in the next years
3. ROCm has to get better yesterday. AMD offers more VRAM at the same price point as NVIDIA, and VRAM is the limiting factor in generating the large LLMs that may prove revolutionary for many industries. NVIDIA, in contrast, is charging quite a bit for VRAM. As long as CUDA is necessary for big model training and deployment in servers, NVIDIA will be able to create artificial bottlenecks with VRAM and collect a large profit.   


The one thing ROCm has done right is minimize the need to adapt CUDA code for it - e.g. a codebase written using PyTorch will not need to be adapted much at all. So the cost to switch looks to have been addressed, what AMD must do now is give a compelling reason to do so by making ROCm a viable alternative for cheaper VRAM.
4. If people have not switched in the middle of a massive shortage, they are not going to switch to Amd.

1. Long time? AMD was not moving at all for one year between Aug 2020 to July 2021
2. They just got an analyst downgrade to equal weight/hold

https://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-stock-price-downgrade-51642672455?tesla=y
3. Big things: 

* Intel released their Alder Lake chips for desktop. These chips outperform AMD CPUs at the same price point. The chip comes with a new microarchitecture that supports a chiplet design with big/little cores. Technology wise Intel is ahead of AMD on some fronts at this point. Particularly on things like DDR5 and PCIe 5.

* Xilinx merger has been put on the back burner, I think there was a legal challenge to the merger.  

Small things: 

* They didn't have much for CES 2022. There were big expectations and their announcements fell slightly short of expectations. Power consumption improvements are cool but they didn't really address the elephants in the room such as their inability to meet demand and Alder Lake. 

* Motherboards and DDR5 prices are coming down and there are new very competitively priced Alder Lake products launching. 

* TSMC is building out a 3nm FAB for Intel and Intel/TSMC cooperation seems to be ramping up. 


I think AMD is in a good spot right now. At least until Sapphire Rapids launches. If Intel clobbers AMD in the server CPU space that will change, but currently Intel does not have a very competitive product in that space.

Now at the price point I did not expect until the very end of the year if not 2022. I want to hold this stock long as I got in at around 70 but my goodness this meteoric rise has to be too good to be true in the midst of a worldwide chip shortage. 

Are we thinking this is for real and it's just going to keep going or is a sharp and sudden stagnation imminent? Rising by the likes of ten dollars a day is surely not going to continue right?!?!

13vr1zd,stocks,"Post: Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.

I know this sub is primarily focused on fundamentals and typically conservative, but there are some big bulls out there.

Can someone explain to me how $NVDA is not overvalued out the ass as every article I read see screams to buy $NVDA as it is a discount right now.

|Company|Market Cap|TTM Rev $M|Pretax Income $M|PE Ratio|

|AMD|153.786B|16,434|3,669|49.89|

When I look at these companies, I do not understand how Nvidia could be priced where it is now. The two big areas of growth people seem to have for Nvidia is the self driving space and the metaverse. Self driving is years away from being viable and there are many players. Isn't metaverse the exact thing that has demolished $FB's market cap? How can you be bullish on one and bearish on the other for the exact same thing?

Earnings are next week and everything seems to scream this is going under. At the same time I am remembering that markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent.

I'm interested in hearing why this stock demands such a premium.

I think AMD will be above $11 by the end of the day. Their report overall was great and their future looks bright. The issue was that they were over hyped and over priced. Now that all the emotional holders are out and the stock has broken the 20% down point, most stop losses have already been triggered and most people who want out have had ample time to do so. There is still a short covering that has to take place and plenty of the long term investors and institutions will start increasing their stakes and averaging down. Also, those who were on the fence or waiting to buy depending on the Earnings report will likely see this as a good entry once the price stabilizes. I'm in for 10 yrs + overall but may increase or decrease my position as big swings occur. I just wanted to get the other side of the argument out since most news I'm seeing is very emotional and negative.... usually a great time to take advantage.

A lot of shorts are covering which is pushing the price back up now. 11.53 looks to be a key resistance and AMD might sell off again once it climbs back up to that level today.

Do you know why their current tax rate is so low? They're still recouping and recovering from eight consecutive years of multi-million dollar losses. Loss carryforwards from the past reduce your present tax liability because your losses offset your earnings.

So AMD have been a rocket the last year but where will it end? and how is China vs USA going to affect the stocks? 

My reason for liking AMD is simply because of the development processes of Chips and their general direction. In addition they are now ahead in many ways to Intel on their production technology by producing chips smaller than Intel is capable of. I see AMD climbing a lot in the future too. But i am concerned about the near future having a mayor correction. People are nervous and is buying gold.

2. Long term AMD is solid.  They are putting effort in the right areas, and are opportunistic when possible without deviating from their long term plan.  (I.e., stocking as much as possible during the bitcoin hype, but not changing their overall supply strategy to impact their expected chip sales).

&#x200B;

Today they will launch their new 7nm platform chip (Rome?), just as worries about Intel vulnerabilities surface for all chips made after 2012.  

&#x200B;

They are a growth company and their P/E reflects that, but they have little to lose at this point.  they are grabbing market share from Intel and doubling their share at this point is not unrealistic.  We can expect them to at least capture 10-20% of the overall market.  They are seeing growth in both consumer and server sales, as well as licensing designs to chinese companies.  The last part, however, I don't see a valuable future play.
3. If you're worried about a correction just wait. Or buy now and buy more later.  
Fair warning I bought some a few weeks ago and sp is down 4 bucks. Only going lower
4. I think they are doing well, but overpriced. Without looking, how much better than Intel do you think AMD is doing right now? 50% as good? Twice as good? 

Well the way AMD is priced right now, it's considered 15 times as good. Its PE ratio is 163.87 while Intel is 10.93.  For the record, Intel's yearly revenue is $70 billion dollars while AMD is just $7 billion. AMD would pretty much have to completely eat up Intel for them to be worth as much as they are right now.
5. Figure out how large a position you want to take, and buy it over a few months to a year versus all upfront, this can help you lower your average cost if there's any big dips in the short term, given your belief that the long term is positive.",07-08-2019 11:44
lsfk88,stocks,"Post: Indicators Explained For Newbies in Stock Market

I along with probably many others here are new to the trading world. GME sparked our interest but we know this isn't how the market usually works. With that being said, I've been doing some research on the different features and functions provided in different web applications so I figured I'd share some basic info here to try and help some others.

Here is a very basic explanation of the different indicators I have got. I guess some of you already have in your charts.

[Macro sentiment](https://cindicator.com/macrosentiment) \- This gives weekly indicators and works best when you have a stock portfolio also if you have option trading. Their risk factor is also improved, through their collective intelligence indicators platform which is an interactive platform between the team and its users where they ask questions about the future trends of the market.  
[BOLL (Bollinger)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/102201.asp) \- This finds the position of a security within Bollinger Bands. %B is simply a percentage measure of a security’s location between the bands. %B can be lower than 0 or higher than 100 if price moves outside the bands. Generally speaking, a %B near or above 100 can suggest an overbought market, while a value near or below 0 can indicate an oversold market.

[DC (Donchian Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/donchianchannels/) \- Are used in technical analysis to measure a market's volatility. It is a banded indicator, similar to Bollinger Bands %B. Besides measuring a market's volatility, Donchian Channels are primarily used to identify potential breakouts or overbought/oversold conditions when price reaches either the Upper or Lower Band. These instances would indicate possible trading signals.

[EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) \- This is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

[IC (Ichimoku Cloud)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) \- A collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on the chart. It also uses these figures to compute a ""cloud"" which attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.

[KC (Keltner Channels)](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000502266-keltner-channels-kc/) \- A banded indicator similar to Bollinger Bands and Moving Average Envelopes. They consist of an Upper Envelope above a Middle Line as well as a Lower Envelope below the Middle Line. The Middle Line is a moving average of price over a user-defined time period. Either a simple moving average or an exponential moving average are typically used. The Upper and Lower Envelopes (user defined) are set a range away from the Middle Line. This can be a multiple of the daily high/low range, or more commonly a multiple of the Average True Range.

MA (Moving Average) - A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Pivot Point - A technical analysis indicator, or calculations, used to determine the overall trend of the market over different time frames. The pivot point itself is simply the average of the intraday high and low, and the closing price from the previous trading day. On the subsequent day, trading above the pivot point is thought to indicate ongoing bullish sentiment, while trading below the pivot point indicates bearish sentiment.

SAR - The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder to determine the direction that an asset is moving. The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR. It aims to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. It can also be used to provide entry and exit points.

SuperTrend - This indicator works well in a trending market but can give false signals when a market is trading in a range. It uses the ATR (average true range) as part of its calculation which takes into account the volatility of the market. The ATR is adjusted using the multiplier setting which determines how sensitive the indicator is.

I'm only a beginner so bare with me I would just like some help with understand the growth of these stocks before I commit to investing


Google - it's one of the most successful companies in the world each year their revenue increases significantly. However they are trading at high valuation which means the market is expecting high growth which might be true but is this likely? If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? 



Apple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society. Also apple are looking into other sectors such as TV or electric cars. However if smart phone are only increasing 2% that would mean if Apple were to grow beyond 2% per year they would need to take market share from their competitors



AMD - Not sure if the valuation is high or not. I believe they are in a duopoly with nvidea and they have around 15% of the sector. I think their valuation may be high so again I'm guessing people on here expect the chip market to grow substantially while mainting their market share? How realistic is this and what differentiates them from nvidea?

I have been thinking hard about this lately. I do watch some YouTubers and I have realized that some of them invested in Tesla prior to 2019. Their return is astronomical. 

That led me to think about apple as well. Both are consumer products and have that “it” factor captivating the audience.

Thanks for sharing your opinions. Some think it’s silly but I think it’s valid. I listen to earning calls and try to evaluate companies from financial perspective as well. But we can’t deny the fact that popularity and a fan base play a big role as well.

&#x200B;

We've missed out havnt we?, what do we do now?, go all in with these near record highs and just ignore my trading account the the next 5 years?

kz682f,stocks,"Post: I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

mzayi3,stocks,"Post: AMD - One of Reddit's fav stock has its earnings tomorrow!

AMD, one of reddit's favorite stocks for the past 4 years has its earnings tomorrow! This company is currently wiping Intel off the menu and has arguably Reddit's fav CEO in Lisa Su. Their earrings are expected to do well so what do you guys think will happen this week for AMD? What new products will they announce? Will their share price finally go past $100? Only time will tell.

AMD actually looks pretty cheap as the Xilinx acquisition still doesn't appear to be fully reflected in the current share price.

I fancy them for a long-term hold but exciting anyway!
4. Bought at $76/share last month. Was debating between AMD shares vs. build-my-own-PC w/ AMD processor but bought the stocks instead. Love AMD as a long-term hold.

6g2tuw,stocks,"Post: Thanks to $NVDA and $AMD, I've finally reached my goal today! :)

http://i.imgur.com/wbCKxo5.png

My main goal has always been to reach $10,000 bar and today, I'm here to say that I've finally managed to pull that off within 1 yr and 9 months of trading.



I've been investing here and there but the main source of this success was two tech monsters: $NVDA and $AMD.
(My very first trade with $AMD was when it was $2.86 per share and $NVDA with $33.) 


Come to think of it, I would have made way more money if I've put 100% of my portfolio into these two but I can't be complaining with what I've already made as a beginner. (I've invested into $DIS, $ATVI, $BABA, $MSFT and more with the two.) 



Though I strongly believe $NVDA and $AMD have more rooms to go north, I'm going to cash everything out and take the profit for now (I'm going to pay out my loan with it.) Half of the profit came from the stocks that I've bought along the way which I'm probably gonna get hit by that 25% tax rate but profit is still a profit I guess :)



Setting everything aside, it feels great to reach my goal!!!

And super smart to cash out and pay off debt. Bravo!

sqvm4k,stocks,"Post: Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?

Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

3. It's a good investment opportunity but no Semi will take you from rags to riches at this point.
4. Why is nobody mentioning TXN? Super profitable, trading at sub 20 PE. Focused on the analog niche to facilitate IoT instead of the digital processor arms race. Gonna get some free gooberment money for building factories in United States. Has Texas in its name.
5. Put it this way, if you have 10+ years left until you need the money, semi’s are pretty much one of the places you should be investing. Enjoy buying on their dip days yo see short gains, but over time they’re one of the most sure bets",12-02-2022 16:45

There were plenty of them in 2023, so what’s your guess for those big gainers in 2024? And, maybe state a quick bullish thesis for your selection as well.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-plunge-leads-magnificent-seven-to-record-weekly-market-cap-loss-8e0a55f7

> The decline in Magnificent Seven stocks has erased a collective $934 billion from their market capitalizations so far this week, which would make for the group’s worst-ever weekly loss of market value if it holds through the close.

> While Tesla Inc.’s stock TSLA, -1.92% is the biggest weekly percentage decliner of the gang from a stock perspective, Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.22%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.27%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -10.00% are bigger contributors to the market-cap losses as they are all worth substantially more than the car maker.

> Nvidia is tracking toward being the biggest market-cap loser of the week, shedding $258 billion with about one hour left in Friday’s trading day. That’s more than the total market capitalization of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -5.44%, at $236 billion.

> Shares of Nvidia are down 10.3% so far this week as the semiconductor sector has been under pressure. Nvidia’s stock is suffering its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2, 2022 on a percentage basis. It’s also down 8.1% in Friday action, putting it on track for its worst single-day percentage drop since it fell 9.5% on Sept. 13, 2022. With the stock down more than $68, it’s heading for its largest one-day price decline on record.

1f97d6c,stocks,"Post: Nvidia says it didn’t receive antitrust subpoena from DOJ



Nvidia on Wednesday denied reports it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.

“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia representative told CNBC. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Nvidia had received a subpoena, causing the stock to [slip in after-hours trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/nvidia-slides-in-post-market-trading-after-drop-wiped-out-300-billion.html). The chipmaker’s shares had already given up nearly 10% during regular trading Tuesday.

While the report did not specify a reason for regulators to be interested in Nvidia, the company’s recent rise has been directly tied to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips for data centers years before competitors AMD and Intel started taking the category seriously.

Nvidia has more than 80% of the data center AI chip market, according to industry estimates.

Nvidia “wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” Nvidia told CNBC.

fyjaff,stocks,"Post: Sharing my top companies with you.

I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

TL;DR. Stonks only go up.

1. Great read, thanks for sharing.

NVDA is pretty overvalued too imo, thoughts?
2. Amazon-AWS, all their cloud stuff is high growth.  Amazon will likely double by 2030.

Nike-They are going digital, direct to consumer sales.  The last earnings report proved how successful that is.  Higher profit margins than brick and mortar.  I bought their shoes online myself, very pleased. One of the strongest brand names.  Good growth ahead, after the virus of course.

1. God this sub keeps messing this up.
AMD pe is elevated due to accounting effects of merger amortization. Non gaap calculations lead current pe of around 30
2. NVDA is lower than AMD? Guess I’m buying more NVDA next week
3. Price/Sales makes more sense no? Earnings can take one-time hits (like acquisitions, e.g., AMD and Xilinx, or just cyclicality like in semiconductors). As a result you're getting some division by 0 extremes.
4. Tbh ratios can be misleading because it only looks at a company for one time period. Intrinsic value is found by determining the present value of the future cash flows of a business, which requires making assumptions based on an understanding of future business profits. There is more nuance than just looking for low PE ratios in investing.

1gnos5a,stocks,"Post: Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications

https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.

kehrkg,stocks,"Post: My 8 investing guidelines.

I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.

Top Comments:
1. Thanks for this. I've just started out and feel like I'm making a lot of mistakes - seems like good guidance to me!!
2. 7a) Don't beat yourself up over successful stocks you were thinking of buying but didn't.

7b) Don't beat yourself up over stocks you sold but which continue to go up in value.
3. came in here expecting way less, but this is very sound advice and i've learned some of these the hard way. nice work
4. Your 6 is so hard. When do you take profits. Solid companies like NET and AMD with 100% gains, do you just let that ride?
5. Still trying to work on #7.

Then again, I tried to convince my parents to put the $10,000 they spent on my car into the stock market to pay for my college education.

My portfolio from high school economics class was:

30% Google - less than $100/share (before all the splits)  
20% Microsoft - Less than $30/share  
20% Apple - Less than $2/share  
20% Amazon - Less than $40/share  
10% Ebay - Less than $20/share  


Funny enough, my professor tried to convince me to put more into a safer stock like an oil company. I was like ""Microsoft isn't a safe stock...?""

The Amazon stocks alone would've paid for my college degree. I also predicted Paypal and Square Up (now Square) being big winners.

2. I say play the whole industry with an ETF. It’s pretty clear the semiconductors are only going to be more and more important as time goes on. They are the physical underpinning to the entire digital world so whether that’s CPUs, GPUs, ASICS, EPYC, something else, you can get all the exposure.

You limit upside but you massively limit downside and IMO probably gonna be market beating over the next decade.
3. I would look to draw parallels to the gear wars, since we have a lot of data from them
4. Check out UTZ if you want a good chip stock
5. My picks are NVDA, INTC and ASML.

ASML seems like the safest of them all to me. It's based on Europe so it has little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly. Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.

I like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.

NVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term.",22-03-2022 21:05

3. This isn’t what Reddit wants to hear, but every semi is likely to be starting its bust cycle. You can see the profit margins for every major chip company and they’re all very cyclical, and will come back down. The time to look into them is when everyone has counted them out.
4. TSM less risky, straight secular play with limited opportunity for product differentiation

AMD more growth potential more risk

I'm much deeper in AMD, above 120 I wouldn't have recommended buying but now I'd definitely get some exposure for anyone who hasn't. Plan to hold at least 3 years.
5. Not really the best time to get either.  I’d wait a bit, especially if the chips act gets through congress.  Personally, SOXL is 3x leverage and gives you some diversification.  I love SOXL/SOXS(inverse).",29-06-2022 17:55

1582vz4,stocks,"Post: AMD suspicious accounting and financial statements? (Goodwill)

AMD has 48 billion non tangible assets (goodwill)! This is a huge red flag/risk that the people who buy into it completely ignore yet it's so easy to spot in prima vista. This goodwill wasn't on the financial statements in 2021, so it has nothing to do with the fame of AMD - it has entirely to do with a recent acquisition that they had of Xilinx. The question every intelligent investor should ask himself is if they seriously payed billions for goodwill alone and not actual assets of the company they acquired? 

For comparison Coca-Cola is one of the most known companies in the world yet being twice more expensive their goodwill is only 33 billion. I don't find any excuse how a company can get 48 billion goodwill assets in a single year just like that, besides it actually doing accounting shenanigans (scam). 

I am looking at the latest financial statement of Xilinx here https://investor.xilinx.com/node/18946/html and I don't see any huge assets/goodwill. I haven't done a great research about this goodwill, but considering that AMD is not more famous in 2023 than it was in 2021 I don't see any reasoning for it's absurdly high goodwill and PE ratio :).  
Such financial tricks were being done back in the dot-com bubble and it was easy to spot when a company inflated it's assets via accounting tricks and illegal/bad practices (several great examples were covered in The Intelligent Investor). Where is the due diligence of the people buying into AMD?  
To put it in other words Benjamin Graham and his disciples would never touch this company even with a stick! 

The only way I could explain this is that they simply had no time to properly organize the Xilinx acquisition in terms of accounting and decided to put everything into Goodwill... But this can be considered still a fraud, no? 

If I am at wrong at the accounting is fine how come Xilinx had only 48 billion in goodwill and nothing more? Are you telling me they had 0 machinery, 0 chips, 0 equipment whatsoever?! I see they had 5.5 billion in assets in 2021, but there is no way they had 48 billion goodwill! I think I haven't even heard about them till digging about this AMD goodwill. And I have heard about Texas Instruments many times.

Top Comments:
1. Goodwill only comes about during acquisitions. It’s the difference between purchase price of the company and the company’s accounting book value. There’s lots of reasons why a company would pay more than the company’s book value.

In your example with Coca Cola, the Xilinx acquisition was 10x the size of cokes largest ever acquisition. 

This isn’t a huge red flag you just don’t know what you’re talking about.
2. Post this on wsb so I can be mean to you while answering your question.
3. Goodwill isn’t automatically bogus… it’s extremely common to see 40-60% goodwill allocations in deals. The valuation and accounting treatment is based on the fact pattern at acquisition. Now, obviously, a company can mismanage or optimistically forecasted, but that doesn’t automatically mean that’s the case. It’s not like those forecasts and valuations are based on total BS - especially in large, highly public deals.

se3uer,stocks,"Post: Why are TSLA and AMD down?

With Tesla’s earnings report beating expectations and AMD announcing the acquisition of Xilinx, you’d think their stocks would be on the rise right now. But instead they’re dipping considerably. Any idea why that might be? Is it for the same reason Nvidia and Lucid are also down (whatever reason that is)?

2. Because the market is irrational.
3. I kinda hate the phrase but this seems like a buy the rumor sell the news case, specially for Tesla. They have been priced to perfection so even though they delivered great results that was already the expectation. Does seem like it’s at a fairly attractive entry point so I wouldn’t be surprised to see it jump again fairly soon
4. Because people are selling…
5. Because sometimes people get spooked about external factors that have nothing to do with a company, and it allows you to buy companies for much less than you'd normally pay.",27-01-2022 17:35

Been reading so much about these two and cannot decide which to buy. NVDA being $185ish atm & AMD floating around $100, both seem like great choice. NVDA being over valued makes AMD a better choice also being cheaper per share, but seems NVDA will be the leader in the long run

1. I have both. They are both powerful companies.
2. Both are good but currently overpriced. NVDA is more overpriced than AMD. so you have o decide which one you like more. In current environment, I will buy AMD below 75$ and NVDA below 120$.

BTW I used to own AMD at 9$. sold at 14$ and still regret it.

3. has potential but it’s pending a merger with xlnx. Been back and forth for months now but if the merger goes through and earnings are strong can definitely break out. AMD has so much going for them with their technology and chips in xbox, ps5, samsung phones, teslas. And if you know anything about cpus for computers the sentiment in the gaming world is intel=bad amd=good. Will reflect in market share in the long run.

I've been around computers for awhile, and I remember when AMD & ATI were separate companies. While Nvidia has no doubt pulled away in the GPU market, ATI at one point made the best cards.

AMD as a company now is like if Intel and Nvidia had a child. Now, that child is finally maturing to a point at which it has all the opportunity in the world to keep growing.",21-06-2021 19:41

Seems like today someone leaked the Intel benchmarks. I noticed this article after reading in the other intel thread that someone claimed that apple was ahead of intel, so I googled it and found this:

>So we have something very interesting for our readers today. We were able to exclusively get our hands on the first-ever benchmarks for Intel's upcoming Alder Lake mobility processors - which are going to go head to head against the Apple M1 Max processors clawing away market share as well as AMD's upcoming mobility chips. While we do not have the scores for AMD's next-generation mobility chips, we do have the scores for the current generation x86 chips as well as the validated score for Apple's M1 Max.

No fan, very low energy consumption and you can throw things at it and you can’t even feel that hiccup.

1e7bk6j,stocks,"Post: What are (in your opinion) the best buying opportunities arising from this dip? 

I’m going to argue personally that nvidia is not one of them. They’re down less than 5% since Tuesday. Of course this metric alone means almost nothing, but I’d like to discuss companies which are great buying opportunities solely because of this dip. 

As others have stated, AMD seems to be a great buying opportunity. It’s down about 15% since Tuesday, from what I believe was already an appealing price. I’d say the same for Qualcomm. 

The broadest and likely “safest” are going to be TSM and QQQ. Personally I’m in a position where I’m deep in TSM and TQQQ, hedged with INTC. 

I’d like to add that I believe these tickers will all run downward a bit longer. I’ve lost bit of $$ due to impatience and buying too early. I do have funds in reserve for when I see evidence of a proper reversal.

I'm just a beginner but there is something wrong with the prices of AMD and Intel. Market value of Intel is 205 419 MUSD while the market value of AMD is 91 188 MUSD. The problem with these is that Intel makes roughly 70 times more money (2019). Surely AMD's earnings will improve more than Intel's and AMD has better future overall but still. 

So, is AMD overpriced or is INTC underpriced

1. I'll keep posting this until people understand that AMD's rise is deserved. 

This is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. 

>TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.

**CPU Context**

Their main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.

Intel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.

But Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.

But then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.

**CPU Manufacturing**

Intel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.

During this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.

**CPU Architecture - Zen**

AMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.

**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**

One of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.

They came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.

**CPU Summary**

The combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.

So now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.

* If you need lots of cores - go AMD
* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)
* If you need features like ECC - go AMD
* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD
* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.

All signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.

**GPUs**

Nvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.

But it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.

A lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.

**Consoles**

Not much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.

**Coronavirus**

AMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.

**Risks**

On the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.

**AMD's Finances**

AMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.

They have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.
2. People been saying it is. I listened to those people at $58 :[
3. I thought that might be the case when it was 20-25.  Again at 30.  I bought at 10.  Recent levels are high but these numbers reflect market share and growth.  That will translate to valuations reflecting that.  This level is tough to justify but as a company they are doing all the right things.
4. My chip portfolio is: 10% Intel, 15% SMIC, 75% TSMC. In the next price drop (double dip recession) I want buy Samsug (3nm process) and AMD. TSMC has p/e 27 and zero competition (other than political tariffs). What would be even better would be to buy the supply chain stocks in the next dip like SUMCO for TSMC
5. Have you seen the new AMD laptops? They re destroying the Intel ones, are incredibly cheaper, and use way less power (talking hours of battery life).

I was never an AMD fanboy, but I wouldn't even consider buying an intel laptop at this point. It is only a matter of time before other big names (outside Asus, Eluktronics, etc.).",04-08-2020 16:19

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/amd-said-to-be-in-advanced-talks-to-buy-xilinx-in-over-30-billion-deal-.html

Advanced Micro Devices is in advanced talks to buy rival chip maker Xilinx in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion, the Wall  Street Journal reported late Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

A deal, which could mark the latest big tie-up in the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry, can come together as soon as next week, the newspaper reported.

AMD has seen a higher usage of its products recently, driven in part by an overall surge in chip demand due to a global shift to work from home, and market-share gains from larger rival Intel.

Thanks for the award.

While it's an acquisition on paper, it not that far from a merger.

3. If you’re basing off a long-term strategy for AMD just off a 20% spike then don’t invest in this sector. Any one of these stocks can jump 10-20% a day, but also go down just as much. If you’re basing off the innovations, a proven track record, steady cash flows, and potential for growth I would go with NVDA personally. Keep in mind that the semiconductor sector is gradually making a change towards AI and autonomous vehicles and it looks like NVDA has the slight edge in that. Be ready for a wild ride tho. 
4. AMD, Lisa Su is amazing, she has turned AMD around and is chipping away at Intel
5. Buy companies because they have fantastic leadership, a solid product roadmap / moat and can back it up.  I like AMD because they are only ever one of 2 x86 vendors. 

Anyone could make hardware to compete where nvidia makes its money. Google / amazon are doing exactly that with dedicated ml hardware. Add on AMD and Intel to competing with nvidia as well, and you realize that nvidia is trying to find new markets like crazy (autonomous vehicles, heavy competition). This is Going to increase costs for research and development.  

Nvidia has a lead in their highly competitive market. But AMD has a big ass moat in one of their markets and a game changing produce line (ryzen).  As well as being a solid second in Nvidias market. ",31-01-2019 04:22
ihyea8,stocks,"Post: How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%

I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.

What is everyone’s thoughts on these types of chip stocks? They are down significantly from a few months ago.

There is still a chip shortage that is expected to continue through 2023. Seems like the hunger for chips is only going to intensify with newer technology requirements for them such as automotive companies pumping out EVs.

Then there is also CHIPS and FABS legislation  
[CHIPS and FABS](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/) which seems amazing for companies in the industry.

Recently AMD destroyed earnings and was up after hours only to sink today probably due to interest rate hike concerns.

What is your take on chip stocks? Are you buying/holding/selling? Why?

I myself bought these stocks and will buy more if they discount further.

1. I'm heavy into MU, followed by NVDA. MU might seem like the most 'boring' but I truly believe that it's criminally undervalued with strong tailwinds moving forward.
2. Since the pandemic, all I've been doing is buying the AMD dip for my 401k. Hopefully I don't regret it in 10 years. 

Bought @ $44, $56, $79 and $86.97 on 4/22.
3. 50% of my portfolio is AMD, I just buy AMD at this stage up until 120. I know diversification is shit but A) dont need my money short term and B) when I do my research it keeps on popping up.
4. My three favorite are NVDA, AMD, and QCOM. 

I like QCOM going after IOT of things and the automotive. They are priced pretty cheap and last earnings showed they are still growing. Their CEO, Cristiano Amon, is pretty awesome and has been company since like '95 as an engineer. Snapdragon is pretty rad. 

NVDA and AMD continue to grow their share of server GPU's. As cloud becomes more important and in continues to grow, both these companies will continue to do well. They are also high margin chips. AMD talked about improving margins back up to 52% next quarter. NVDA with their AI is awesome. You are paying a higher premium, but I think it's worth it for the growth we are seeing.

And she said it is competitive with the competing Intel i9-9900K processor at less than half the price of what Intel is charging.


- AMD has shifted much of its processor line-up to 7-nanometer manufacturing (which, because of nomenclature, is the equivalent of Intel’s 10-nanometer manufacturing)


- Su said that AMD’s chips are targeting all parts of gaming — cloud gaming via data center hardware, PC gaming, and console gaming. AMD also recently partnered with Samsung to move into mobile markets. AMD’s chips will power Google’s Stadia infrastructure for cloud gaming, and AMD’s chips will be the heart of the upcoming PlayStation 5 from Sony.

1. AMD is one of two companies in the world with x86 license. Their new Ryzen desktop lineup is kicking Intels ass, (intel is the other company with the license).  

They also make GPUs, and their mid to low end is highly competitive with Nvidia, although Nvidia has better high end. 

They are exclusive suppliers for chips for XBOX and Playstation.

Their server chips which power cloud computing are top of the line when it comes to price performance and are just demolishing most of the competition.

Their new mobile chips are excellent as well.

Also their CEO, Lisa Su is simply a genius for what she has been able to accomplish thus far

3. It is quite clear you have a very good understanding of the cloud. It simply does not need hardware to run. How does it run? I’m not sure, but surely not hardware
4. They make computer processors soooo, as long as there's demand for computers, there will be demand for amd products. They also make graphics processors. Nvidia makes gpu's, they don't make cpu's.
5. TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.

**CPU Context**

Their main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.

Intel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.

But Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.

But then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.

**CPU Manufacturing**

Intel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.

During this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.

**CPU Architecture - Zen**

AMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.

**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**

One of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.

They came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.

**CPU Summary**

The combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.

So now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.

* If you need lots of cores - go AMD
* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)
* If you need features like ECC - go AMD
* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD
* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.

All signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.

**GPUs**

Nvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.

But it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.

A lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.

**Consoles**

Not much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.

**Coronavirus**

AMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.

**Risks**

On the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.

**AMD's Finances**

AMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.

They have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",21-07-2020 00:45

1et5yvq,stocks,"Post: Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’

I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.

when your core holding is 24 billion dollars of alphabet stock which has out preformed the market, it covers a lot of mistakes. 

Eric wants sam to hire him to be the adult in the room, and every statement he makes should be viewed through that lens, and he might just get the job.

I know no one can predict this for sure but since 90% of semiconductor-grade neon comes from Ukraine, if Russia goes to war with them how will it impact stocks from companies that rely on it? Primarily AMD and Nvidia, but also companies like Microsoft, Tesla, Apple etc. which also rely on semiconductors for manufacturing, would their stock prices go down? I would imagine, especially since the entire stock market would take a hit, but particularly those that rely on imports from those countries.

I sold all my NVDA stock last week of February (due to written call options being executed at $785). Since I still strongly believe in NVDA long term, I plan to buy them back on the next pullback.. I just wont allow myself to sell low, buy high..

Since NVDA represented around 30% of my portfolio, I have quite a bunch of cash sidelined now.. What would you recommend to invest this in, given my plan to reinvest this amount in NVDA within the next year?

1. Everyone take a deep breath.

Saying I told you so to people isn't going to help things. Key take away's from today: AMD pretty much met expectations....that's not a bad thing. They have done well enough to put themselves in position to become profitable. It just so happened that people expected more, and that's why its down.


If you are in an investor in AMD what you need to do today: Determine if what happened today is something that will change your opinion on your beliefs in the company. If yes: You should look to exit your position (however you choose to is up to you). If no: You now have a chance to buy this stock at a discount or continue to hold through this turbulence. 


**REMEMBER:** You don't have gains or losses until you officially exit a stock. As long as you remember this and keep calm you can make level headed decisions. When you make a level headed decision you usually can make the best choice for you.

Intel new GPU that was released 3 months ago in October 2022 has already strated taking market share from AMD in the last quarter of 2022.altough it's only 4% market share at the moment the GPU is extremly new and better GPUs will be released in th coming years which can cause intel to take significant market share from AMD in the GPU market.

so what do you think?can Intel new GPU change everything in the chip market?

and do you think it can also take market share from Nvidia?

tell me what you think.

Top Comments:
1. I think Intel is approaching a market that has consistently overcharged on their prices during the COVID and Mining pandemic, leading to an infuriarted consumer demographic. Intel is coming to the rescue by providing 'budget GPU's' at low cost, but good cost/performance ratio. 

Intel's GPU don't weigh up against AMD or Nvidia in terms of quality, but they took a perfect time to enter the market to fill a budget-niche. I am hopeful they can expand it in the future
2. I think OP is getting mixed up. The article mentions:

>Intel's Xe discrete GPUs are a new generation of graphics processors introduced in late 2020 and early 2021.

Those are not the same as the ARC models released last year to compete with mid range GPUs. The Xe are scaled up versions of their integrated cards, I thought even the Xe ones were integrated. 

Rumors I heard was ARC was cancelled cause they lose their 1200 developers in Russia. 

Intel has always had a lead in GPUs since many of their CPUs now ship with an integrated GPU which is good enough for most ppl. Its the dGPU market where their share is 0, and the Xe GPUs are also not sold for desktops, its only for laptops/prebuilt systems:

[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html)

&#x200B;

You can't go to Bestbuy and buy these things, so its not really a true stat just like how Intel sells the most GPUs annually since all their CPUs come with one.
3. Intel's dGPU (Dedicated GPU) release was such a dumpster fire that they canned the majority of future dGPU products, realigned the company's reporting to NOT have the AXG (graphics) division report its standalone revenue and earnings, and demoted the guy who was running the group.

Their overly ambitious data center GPU (Ponte Vecchio) still hasn't been released and when it is, won't even beat out AMDs last-gen MI250X. It's already behind NVDAs H100 and AMDs forthcoming MI300.

There *may* be reasons to choose INTC over AMD/NVDA, but I personally do not believe anything low-end, low-margin graphics-related should be in that conversation.
4. Four percent seems extraordinary to me in such a short time.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g8IVI0sZ6F8
5. Too many Intel bag holders here.

If you think this moves the needle while they are also losing data center share you are delusional.  It'll never be big enough to move the needle on the stock.",10-01-2023 14:10
8yh106,stocks,"Post: NVDA (and possibly AMD) is screwed for Q2 Earnings

First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock.  A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys.  But for Q2 earnings they're fucked.

1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this.  Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower.  Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards.  A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later.

2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being.  The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about):
> “Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million,” Kress said. “Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.”

Since Nvidia's total revenue was [$3.207 billion](https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/NVIDIA-Q1Y19-Form-10Q.pdf) in the first quarter, this means a 7% drop in revenue Q/Q due to only cryptocurrency.

3: [Gigabyte, a company which makes NVDA cards saw their revenue fall 30% in june.](http://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t05st10_e?TYPEK=sii&step=show&co_id=2376&year=2018&month=06) This is the most direct evidence revenues are going to massively fall, as this was right when graphics cards saw a huge price drop.  

4: [Allegedly there was an OEM who returned 300,000 GPUs back to Nvidia.](https://wccftech.com/nvidia-oem-partner-300k-gpu-inventory-issues-next-gen-geforce-delay/)  If this is true that is around $150 million in revenue lost assuming an average price of $400 per card (really rough estimate).  That's another 7% meaning these two things combined could show a 14% loss in revenue Q/Q.  This shows another instance of inventory mismanagement on NVDA's part.

All in all NVDA could see a large drop in earnings.  Due to the nature of this stock, however, there's no telling if it actually goes down after earnings.  If AMD earnings come out bad that will prove some of these points and give you a warning as to what NVDA earnings hold, so I suggest watching AMD if you will play NVDA.

-

TL;DR: NVDA made too many cards cause of crypto or something else, GPU prices are down, and their earnings are fucked.

2. AMD kept saying in their earnings calls that crypto was not included in their numbers and forecasts. Take that for what it's worth.

Don't know about NVDA's reporting method.
3. I’m starting to feel a little crazy here and I havnt actually spent the time to go back and confirm this, but a while ago I saw a breakdown of their revenue streams and crypto was something like 5% of total. Maybe this has changed or I’m just remembering incorrectly but I see a lot of stuff on this sub talking about how crypto will make or break their business which seems funny if it really is such a small fraction of their revenue. *i know you referenced more than just crypto

Edit: regardless you make good points and I’ll be considering some stop orders soon. Your points combined with the slight potential for them to get wrapped up in this China trade shit seems like it could be a bummer in the making

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

14avon6,stocks,"Post: Intel to invest $4.6 billion in new chip plant in Poland

Intel plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in a new semiconductor assembly and test facility near Wrocław, Poland, as part of a multi-billion-dollar investment drive across Europe to build chip capacity, it said on Friday.

The U.S. chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany along with facilities in Ireland and France as it seeks to benefit from European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.

The facility in Poland will employ 2,000 workers and create several thousand additional jobs during the construction phase and hiring by suppliers, the company said in a statement.

""Poland was just a little bit hungrier to win this site,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a news conference.

Several countries have been vying to get Intel to invest in their regions and some, like Germany, who have secured a commitment from Intel, have been in talks on the amount of subsidies they can doll out.

Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday that the German government and Intel were close to an agreement for 9.9 billion euros ($10.83 billion) in subsidies, up from a previously agreed 6.8 billion.

""We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for competitiveness,"" Gelsinger said in an interview.

""Labour costs have gone up substantially, material costs have gone up substantially, so all of a sudden, the cost gap was bigger than we had originally estimated.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with Gelsinger on Monday, a government spokesperson said in Berlin.

Gelsinger declined to provide detail on the subsidy amount, but said he hopes to come to an agreement.

""The gaps are too big. If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward,"" Gelsinger said.

The level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.

Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.

Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory ""the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland"".

The company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.

It expects the facility to come online by 2027.

Intel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.

Nvidia is currently more valuable than google and Amazon as a company. So the valuation is nuts.

Currently at $721, dollars you see a “surprise” jump of their earnings are higher than analysts expect?


Additionally, do you think if the bubble bursts it’ll take other similar stocks down like Amd, Qualcomm etc?

1. It will stay flat and destroy every option buyer.
2. I’ll probably buy 1 share sometime this week, and if it drops after the earnings call I’ll buy 2 more shares of the dip.
3. It's incredibly undervalued, there are 8 billion people on earth so we need 800 billion GPUs in data centers and we're nowhere close to that.  AI is so powerful that just mentioning it in an earnings report triples sales overnight for any company.

5. Positive earnings can gap a stock down, and negative earnings can gap a stock up.  It's not so much the earnings, but rather the market reaction that's important.

1dkcx7k,stocks,"Post: Best long term stocks to invest in?

EDIT: I bought 10 MSFT, thanks for the advice!



Hi all, I am investing $15k today for some long term stocks. I already put about $7k of it into 50 NVIDIA, $2.6k into 100 Palantir, and $480 into 100 RKLB. Was wondering what would be good to invest the remaining $4.9k? I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?

i6oghd,stocks,"Post: The Stock Market Phenomenon That New Investors Should Know

You’re thinking about buying but the price just keeps going up and up so you’re waiting for a pull back but it doesn’t happen.

- When you don’t buy it keeps going up
- When you buy is when it drops
- After you sell at a loss it goes back up

For some reason the market goes against your decisions. It’s taunting and laughing at you. It’s chosen you specifically and while Yahoo convos question “I don’t get it—why is this stock down today?” you know why.


Always buy, hold, stop looking at it every second, and stop making Reddit threads when you’re down 2%.

Top Comments:
1. I’ve stopped buying full positions at one time. Will buy a 1/2 position and wait a while. If the price goes down I average down. If it goes up I make a decision to either trickle in or use that money else where. Averaging down when a stock drops after buying is one of the best tools I’ve ever learned to use.
2. Jim Kramer said it best and it really resonated with me. He said (I’m paraphrasing)

“Buy stock at a good price.”

What is a good price to you? That’s all you gotta ask yourself. When you really understand the company’s decisions and margins. Really study it’s assets, and quarterlies, then the length of your hold also comes into focus.

I heard else where for those building a portfolio, to buy like you want to keep buying over ten years. If something dips and you can afford it, maybe double down. If something gains, keep holding. The general trajectory is it will build the longer you stay in.

I'm not making any moves yet, but I'm getting my shopping list ready and there are some absolutely crazy values out there right now.

1. PYPL - Currently trading at a price it hasn't seen since 2018, and is at the lowest P/E in its entire history. The last time the P/E was anywhere near this low was back in 2016. At that time PYPL's EPS was $1\`.11. It's now at $3.03. So it's trading at levels not seen in years but is earning triple what it was earning back then.
2. GOOG - Currently trading at the lowest P/E in more than 7 years. It came close to this level back in 2019, when it was earning $49.50/share. It's now earning $110.50, more than double what it was earning then.
3. DOCU - Currently trading at a P/S of 6.3. The last time it was at this sales ratio was back in 2019, pre-COVID. At that time it was generating $7.84/share in revenue. It's now generating $10.70/share. Gross margins are higher now too.
4. CHWY - Currently trading below its IPO price at the dirt cheap P/S of 1.1. The previous lowest P/S was 3.2, back at the IPO when it was generating $13.40/share in revenue. It's now generating $21.30/share in revenue on higher gross margins.

Bottom line: there are some companies out there trading at or below past levels despite generating considerably more earnings or sales now than they were back then. The unprofitable ones will rebound more slowly, but these are the higher quality companies that the smart money will start snapping up when it looks like the dust is settling. So be ready.

1. Can we talk about google?  The PE dropped below 20 today.  The board has announced last month at some point they will buy back to the sum of 70b.  They are headed into a 20/1 split.  Introduced new products today including a watch.  As companies look for discounts in cloud spending, google becomes quite tempting from AWS/Azure.

I went back in the market today with 100 shares.  I don’t even care if the market drops tomorrow, this company is a good buy.

Everything the bears will say in this thread has already been factored in.  Really PE ratio of 19?
2. PE may matter in stable times. In these times the PE could be misleading; in future quarters if earnings shrink, your PE goes up. The market is weighing in saying that it believes these companies will have declining earnings.
3. this is a millionaire maker market if i ever saw one. 

high quality tech growth stocks are all trading like garbage weed stocks. 

I like $SE and $MELI. $SE has $10B in cash. makes $10B in revs p.a. grows 30% YoY. will turn fcf positive within couple of yrs. EV / S of 2x at market cap just above $30B.

Post says it all.  TSLA is now worth $1.1T after the Hertz announcement.  The market cap increased from $864B to the $1.1T in 4 days.  That's a total of $236B increase in less than a week. The four day increase alone is worth more than Ford, GM, Nissan, and Honda total market caps combined ($67B, $79B, $22B, & $54B respectively).  Four days....it increased by the size of some of the largest car producers in the US combined.  It's total market cap is nearly 5X those same companies combined (you could own each of them 5X with TSLA market cap).

All of that for a company that has less than $4b in operational income YTD, which by the way is about 8X less than the combined income generated by the aforementioned car producers.  To also put that into perspective, it is now worth more than Facebook by $150B (that's a whole AMD market cap) which has generated 10X the net income YTD.

""Alibaba’s Yitian 710 CPU is built on TSMC’s 5nm manufacturing process and boasts a staggering 128 cores and 60 billion transistors per die.

Based on Arm’s v9 architecture, the processor reaches speeds of up to 3.2GHz and supports up to eight DDR5 memory channels and 96 PCIe 5.0 lanes""

1. What makes you think AMD doesn’t have the capabilities of designing ARM chip? Both Xilinx and Pensando are ARM based.
2. Interesting.  If Taiwan Semiconductor is making this for them at their Taiwan location, why would China get into a kinetic war with Taiwan?
3. ARM is a RISC, Intel/AMD are microcode implemented CISCs over a RISC core. Both of them have capabilities to make RISC processors, just look at their FPGA lines. Also although ARM might be good enough for a locked ecosystem like apple, it's not for a open one where you have to interact with thousands of different hardware configurations. So they support faster RAM, can you swap it at will? How about bus width? Hardware enumeration? Can you make a OS that's compatible with different implementations without having to change and recompile for each one?  Many things are missing in ARM.
4. Intel is not a buy because their next product line is gonna best ARM or anyone else for that matter. Intel is a buy because they are at a low and are beginning a long term investment phase in manufacturing capability in the US and EU.
5. I think part of the upside for intel and amd is that it’s become a pretty topical issue that we are behind on domestic chip capabilities and that is a focus with billions of dollars behind it. So as TSMC does better it pushes further investment in domestic chip producers",17-04-2022 10:58

2. I’m a long time AMD bagholder. The biggest risk, by far, is supply. Specifically, Intel has a ton of money and they could do what Apple did and throw a bunch of money at TSM to reserve production capacity. There’s a report saying exactly that, too. Intel has reserved 3nm with TSM. The real question is how much.

Other than that, AMD will lose market share in desktop, because Intel is actually going to try now. AMD will gain in laptops and datacenter, which will more than make up for the losses in desktop. The second half of 2021 will see AMD profits rising massively.

Is AMD price going to shoot back up since its most likely to be the semiconductor winner in the next couple of years or am I completely missing something?

Top Comments:
1. Amd’s strongest growth is happening in server and mobile and with their current and upcoming hardware releases they are slated to continue taking market share. 

They have never had a better opportunity to take gpu market share with Nvidia pricing the 4000 series this way and in a couple months we will see how this turns out but gpus is a smaller part of amd's business and growth. The mining bust will destroy Nvidia while leaving amd fairly untouched comparably because their gaming gpus last generation were simply not good for mining and thus didn’t have the same inflated demand. 

Market will shrink but I believe amd will grow faster and offset any losses with market share gains. Their server CPU’s were supposedly back ordered by months thanks to substrate shortage. We saw they didn’t even bother to release low end zen3 for a long time and it was only now in 2022 that some of their zen3 products were released even though the architecture was released in 2020. They left money on the table thanks to demand and supply being so far off each other. 

Amd have technologies that put it ahead of the competition, yet their market share is still “tiny”.
2. Intel is not valued for perfect execution. AMD and Nvidia are. If Intel only delivers half of what they plan to do next 3 years stock price and dividend should be fine.
3. I've started averaging in. 

God knows how long this market pull back will go on and where AMD will bottom out though. 

November will be key short term. 

If they release the 7700XT for $500 to $600 I'd expect a good move up. 

If they don't and release the 7800XT and 7900XT only and only slightly undercut Nvidia then.. meh.
4. They way I see it, chip design is slowly becoming a commodity, while actually being able to produce them is where the competitive advantage will be. Simply because of the insane CAPEX moat and actual know-how needed in supply-chain and logistics. I know we’ve just been through a decade or two of asset-light being King, and for a lot of things that will still be true, but fabs are just so insanely complex and expensive, I don’t see the likes of Apple or Google going full vertical integration in that area, or new competitors springing up any time soon.

Sure, you might be able to carve out an edge by constantly being at the bleeding edge of high performance chip design, but just like AMD in the end beat out Intel by “gluing together” chips, instead of fighting Moore’s Law to push single core performance ever higher, I don’t think the future will be as advantageous to companies who can push out the last 5-10% performances at absurd margins, when you can get 3 to 5 times the horsepower by spinning up lower priced hardware.

Unless fabs somehow get commoditised by future technology, I see the big 3 producers fighting it out amongst each other, and a much larger amount of smaller players duking it out when it comes to designing the chips, with the biggest customers having their own in-house chip design. 

All in all, I have more faith in Intel turning it around in the future, with their fabs, than AMD and nVIDIA continuing to dominate and grow like they currently are. They are all 3 good players,  but only one of them is not currently priced to perfection, for growth that might not happen.

I feel like laptops are ultimately going the way of arm over x86 because they're so much more power efficient (which matters a lot to the every day user) and Microsoft is taking a major interest in getting windows 11 to run flawlessly on arm. They're also taking Apus very seriously and their performance is getting to the point where you won't even need a dedicated GPU for gaming.

After dropping more than 33% last year amid aggressive interest rate hikes and stubborn inflation, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has recovered roughly 12% in 2023. Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors’ bubble this week. 

Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He’s expected to discuss February’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated “ongoing” rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.”

Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not “overly hawkish”—repeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance—every time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.

As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell “retreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone” during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed’s benchmark interest rate.

Top Comments:
1. The funny part is that Powell and the Fed have been extremely consistent, saying the same thing over and over for the past few months.

As the market rallied in 2023, every time Powell has a chance to speak he reiterates that the Fed will hike rates higher than the market thinks and will keep rates there longer than the market thinks. He continues to say this but the market continues to not believe him.

It's comical to watch this play out.
2. Watching the hearing right now, I think it's fair to say this hearing is barely concerning the business of the Fed. Senators are giving speeches about how the Biden administration is causing inflation, or that there are not enough Latinos in the fed.
3. > recent labor market strength warrants a “tighter stance of monetary policy.”

It's legitimately a class war, isn't it? I thought the free market meant you let the invisible hand sort it out. If labor is in demand price elasticity will do it's thing and the most important labor will go to the most important use. This works for steel but not for labor? Blshit.

GlobalFoundries Inc. (Nasdaq: GFS) (GF), a global leader in feature-rich semiconductor manufacturing, today announced that it has agreed to amend its Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with AMD to increase the volume of chips GF will supply as well as extend the terms of the agreement to secure supply through 2025. The agreement also expands the breadth of the partnership, including supply assurance for AMD chips serving the datacenter, personal computing, embedded and other growth markets. 

GF has been manufacturing high-performance chips for AMD for more than 12 years, and this new agreement extends this long-standing partnership to ensure supply for AMD's growing business. With this agreement, AMD now expects to purchase approximately $2.1 billion of wafers from GF between 2022 and 2025.

""We have been working closely with our customers for more than a year to help address the ongoing supply-demand imbalance in our industry,"" said Tom Caulfield, GF CEO. ""Our amended agreement with AMD is a prime example of our customers' desire and willingness to secure long-term supply. This agreement not only increases the volume of chips we will be producing for AMD, it also secures and extends their supply through 2025.""

The global demand for semiconductors is growing at an unprecedented rate, and GF is responding to this growth through a series of strategic long-term agreements with existing and new customers and simultaneously expanding global capacity to meet customer demand.

3. Just picked up some shares of this on the fly.  Have been wanting to invest longer term in AMD for a while, so this might be a pick and shovel way of getting into AMD but at a lower price point per share.  Guess we will see how it goes.
4. At this point Im just waiting if the XLNX merger goes through. Lisa said until this year's end, but deadline is drawing close. Xilinx reinstating dividends too looks like a bad sign for me. I just hope this wont go tits up on me

1gl3byx,stocks,"Post: Will Nvidia suffer due to increased tensions with China?

I want to be clear this is not a political post. Not looking for political opinions.

  
Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

2. If it means they dip in price then I’ll keep on buying, Nvidia will outlast Trump so Imma keep holding for the long term.
3. I dumped my NVDA stock because I worried about this to be honest.  The reward vs the risk of things heating up everywhere overseas has me too worried and NVDA is already pretty high right now.
4. 1. If anyone could decouple from NVDA, they would. Everyone - from Xi Jinping to Sam Altman - has big ideas about designing their own AI chips. So far, no one can.
2. Trump says a lot of crazy things.
5. 1. China will probably have 5-7 years before it goes it own way, and NVDA is not needed in China's chip design ecosystem.

2. Same with TSMC.  There are 2 fabs in China already.  China is already developing chip fab technology independent of ASML.  Either TSMC joins China ecosystem in new fab technology, or it will try to remain in the good graces of the US and the West.",06-11-2024 17:04

1. Not my own stock pick, per se, but my grandfather was high up in PG back in the day and was given stock options every year. He ended up giving each of his kids (3) and (9) grandkids ~200 shares when they were born. 

Those shares put me through college, gave me enough to put a down payment on a house, and I still hold ~2,000 shares. He passed last summer and I can’t help but wonder all of the things he could’ve bought for himself with all of those shares. Instead, he chose to live within his means and pass on his wealth to his family.

I plan to do the same for my family and can only hope to be half the selfless, humble man he was. RIP Papa ❤️
2. AMZN at $193
3. I bought AMD in 2012 for $3.00 a share. Sold 1/2 my position at $55. Still holding the other half. 

Bought a bunch of ATVI for an average cost of around $12/share between 2010 & 2012. Again sold half my position around $70

Let’s see where these two go over the next year. 

Thankfully these gains were more than enough to offset the GE shares I bought around that same time.

1dkb5n3,stocks,"Post: Thoughts on Intel as long-term?

I’ve been reading about Intel’s plans to transform the company into a manufacturing specific operation with the goal of producing chips locally and eventually pulling companies like Nvidia and AMD away from TSMC.

Additionally with their recent $8.5 billion in funding from the government under the CHIPS act, is it safe to say that Intel will bounce back and be doing well again with their new focus sometime in the next 3-5 years?

n6x0fa,stocks,"Post: IBM has revealed a new chip technology that promises massive improvements in both power and energy efficiency.

Thoughts on IBM and this technology? It seems like this could be a dominant technology in semiconductors in a few years.

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

1. This is classic IBM press release stuff - see all their breakthroughs that will revolutionize computing from 10 years ago - IBM, the king of overpromising and underdelivering. 

Like seriously, does anyone believe they have come up with a process that is even remotely scalable? They don't even mention how - what litho processes were used, etc.
2. This just benefits the likes of Apple, AMD, and NVDA who are free to choose between TSMC and Samsung foundrys.  Meanwhile Intel plans to spend 30 billion just to get their 7 nm node working and producing while everyone else is already on 5 to 2 nm.  Intel is throwing money at the problem just so they can be behind again.  And if Intel gives up and licenses IBM 2nm tech, it just further erodes Intel's diminishing margins and shows how far behind Intel is in their own process development.
3. I'm just waiting for a good report on their quantum technology..
4. they made it to 7nm about 4 years before Intel/TSMC

But it didn't translate into any real mainstream products or marketshare (as far as I know)

it's technically impressive, but being technically impressive doesn't generate money
5. Didn't IBM sell Fishkill fab and go fabless? In this case they are working with TSMC or Global Foundries or someone else still left?

EDIT: Apparently they are working with Samsung on new process which every chipmaker is doing. Announcing something 3-4 years in advance is vaporware to generate positive buzz. I don't doubt we will have 2nm chips sometime in future but when we do, 1-2 foundries will be making them and everyone big (nVidia, Apple...) will be designing chips.

And consider it wouldnt be just Taiwan,  you'd have a good chance of the conflict spreading to S Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and/or Japan, at a minimum you'd have embargoes and sanctions flying all over the place.

u8fb6r,stocks,"Post: Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is

Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  
**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  
**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) 

*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*

2. >and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions).

I don't think you understand how Bond Prices work. They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....

>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into

Yes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.

>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.

Uh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.

>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates

Inflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.

Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS

I already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle

The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

Which.... would be Consumer Staples....

>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.

Growth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.

TL;DR - Not going to respond to every point, but you're missing the mark completely.

17wju7x,stocks,"Post: ""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?

I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.

4. Nobody knows. The whole point of investing in an ETF for the SP500 is to diversify. So you will get stocks that overperform and that underperform. Since in the long term, you don't know which stock will do what, you take them all. This year these tech companies overperformed. In other years they have or might not.

If you are convinced they will overperform, then of course buy them. Personally, since they already make up a large amount of the SP500 in an ETF, I am happy to just keep it at that.

ENPH is my solar stock, clean energy is the direction we are going so I feel confident in this sector. ENPH was popular on this sub about a year ago. Great gains but there’s other solar/clean energy companies too. 

SPCE I think will pop and jump within 2 years. I’ve had consistently gains so fair in 2020, and I think the hype will come similar to TSLA, best case. By 2021 hopefully they have a finished commercial flight done. 

Besides that my FB has been consistent as I’m over 20% in gains even after the drop a few days ago. I recently sold my WM, CSCO, DIS, SBUX, ABBV, and F to allocate to something else that’s giving me better gains, held for a year and got dividends but I had much better gains in some of my other positions. 

Mind you I don’t do too much research. I also hold TSLA and AMD

wfp8rt,stocks,"Post: How does AMD compare to NVDA?

I'm well aware of each of these companies' financial statements but I actually don't know that much about either of these companies' business models. I know they're both oriented towards data centers and to a lesser extent gaming but what's the main difference between the two? I know NVDA is getting into the AI sector - is AMD doing the same? What are AMD's future prospects? Is it possible that, in 20 years, AMD could have a year with a revenue growth rate of 30% (not saying 30% CAGR for the next 20 years - just wondering if it has the business model to be able to pull off impressive growth at any given point of time in the future)? NVDA has a higher multiple right now so the market obviously thinks it has better future prospects. What are you thoughts on that?

Top Comments:
1. They have significant overlap these days thanks to the Xilinx and Pensando purchases giving AMD products in areas they didn't compete previously (AI/ML acceleration, automotive, some parts of networking), but Nvidia doesn't offer as broad a portfolio as AMD does currently.

That being said, Nvidia has owned the data center GPU market for many years and has a strong networking portfolio thanks to buying Mellanox a few years back with one of the strongest software moats of anyone not named Microsoft, so they've been very successful and are very richly valued as a result.

AMD does seem poised to take some share in the data center GPU market, but it's an uphill fight with any successes mostly limited to HPC so far. 

I'd still favor AMD over NVDA given the more diversified business, less rich valuation, and their status as a share taker in both CPUs and GPUs, plus what I regard as an essentially unrivaled silicon IP portfolio (CPU, GPU, DPU, FPGA, SoC, and 2.5/3D packaging) that gives them enormous flexibility in deciding what markets to compete in.
2. Amd probably has more growth potential, either way strong holds in the long term.
3. The Youtube channel ""2 Minute Papers"" will give you some idea of what NVIDIA is doing with AI. AMD is not competing in that area at all.
4. NVDA - makes GPUs and has AI platforms. Their chips have seen gaming and crypto-mining tailwinds. It is the GPU leader, bar none. Most compellingly, its chips are used in data centers which is the most attractive part of the semiconductor side of its portfolio.

AMD - makes processors for computers like Intel but its absolutely destroying Intel and eating that company's market share, which makes it a big winner. It also makes GPUs like NVDA, but they're not market-leading. It's chips are also used in data centers, which has seen explosive growth.

Personally, I think both stocks look expensive. I can't pretend to understand where NVDA sits in the AI development world, so I stay away because the semiconductor side seems a bit overpriced especially as we hear gaming companies come out with less-than-stellar quarters and the recent crypto crash. I'd buy this stock for the data center story and AI story, but at lower multiples.

AMD is more reasonably valued and is probably near fair value since it is such a share-taker in its space. 

I believe there are better chip stocks out there than these two, especially given their higher multiples, that being said there is no doubt these are best-in-breed chipmakers and companies, and I wouldn't argue passionately that you wouldn't see returns even investing at these levels but given their strong outperformance recently I personally would wait for a price correction for jumping in.
5. Both are moneymaking machines with some overlap and much uniqueness.

2. Like everything else in life, you are hedging risk by capping profits.  The important part is to pick the price point you would be happy to exit the long position at, and the premium becomes the cherry on top.
3. I sold CC on GOOGL throughout the bear market and had decent returns without shares being called away. I’d sell 30-45 DTE for a price around 1% of the underlying. 

The issue now is volatility is so low (VIX at 12) that premiums aren’t really worth it. I was looking today and to get 1% on Jan 19 exp would have to sell options only about 5% above the current share price.. totally not worth it as the stock has done like 10% in a week..
4. It’s up to you on how risky you want to be and how much time you want to invest. I write covered calls often. On the stocks I don’t mind losing, which is really only when I’m doing the wheel strategy, I use a .4-.3 delta. I’ll sell them monthly and check on them every couple days. If the stock moves a ton, I’ll roll it back a month or two and out a little more (getting more premium in the process), but at a certain point it doesn’t make sense to roll and I just let it take my stock. At that time I’ve made good premium selling calls and gains on the stocks increase. I’ll then start selling puts. 

If I do care about the stock though or I’m doing a poor man’s covered call, I’ll target a .3-.2 (sometimes lower) delta. The premiums are much less, but there is less risk as well. If it does explode for some reason I’ll roll. If it continues to explode, I’ll roll at a loss just to push it even further out and into a .1ish delta. I don’t mind losing some of the premium if the stock is going up a ton and I want to hold for the long term. 

Remember. Covered calls are best on stocks moving slightly up, slightly down, or staying flat. The more volatility, the higher the premium, but the higher the risk of it hitting your strike.

ew3ws4,stocks,"Post: What's gonna happen with AMD long term

What we are seeing with AMD right now is what we expected. People are not gonna buy AMD products as soon as they release, because that would be stupid. 
The span of powerful gaming rigs and workstations is around 5 years, so if 70% of the people made theirs before the AMD release they would have used Intel chips and all that jazz. So we won't see a significant rise in the sales until people start upgrading, and they will go with AMD, because they're crushing right now. So best case scenario everyone built their rig around 5 years ago they are upgrading now, worst case they built it the day before AMD releases and we have to wait 5 years. But overall I think AMD will see the biggest increase around 2/3 years forward. 
This is just me excusing spending all of my 2k I needed for rent this month in AMD stocks and not seeing immediate gainz.

1. It sounds like you’re trying to convince yourself you haven’t made a terrible buy.
2. Amd is up 116% in one year.. they had a good earnings, but the bar was set so high that it really didn’t matter. Still a good 10+year stock hold imo
3. Not everyone who built a computer built it at the same time, that 5 years ago for me could be today to upgrade while for someone else thats in a year time, so they’ll do it then.

And honestly I think a lotttt of people upgrade way more frequently than 5 years, especially if they keep doing really affordable powerful processors and hopefully one day graphics cards, it’ll be affordable so people will just be like “fuck it” and do it anyways.
4. A lot of people on Reddit don’t understand that a good product doesn’t always equal a good stock to buy....



They’ve gone up ~120% in 1 year and with a P/E of 254, there’s *massive* levels of hype and expectation around the stock. Anything less than *spectacular* will send this thing tumbling down. Eventually reality will set in, and financial gravity will return.

1. ride the tech dip. Tech will be back with a vengence
2. I feel AMD is best long term. Everyone here mentions it’s extremely undervalued, odds are I’m gonna buy if it continues to dip today.
3. I made a post yesterday explaining that AMD was in a bear market. Needs to regain the 50 week moving average to be considered a buy again. Looks to be headed to a test of its 9.50 area. This is where fundamental analysis is key. If your DD says AMD is undervalued, then hold. If you bought it because others bought it then sell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7hcug0/4_tech_stocks_to_consider_shorting_this_month_amd/
4. My feeling and educated guess is that in a year or 2 (when server CPUs and laptop CPUs add to bottomline), AMD will end up somewhere between 15-30 dollars. Probably 20-25. So if you are patient just leave them.
5. I'd hold. If it dips more you could easily average down your price per share if you wanna toss some more money on it. More than likely you're young so you got time to play. Set a stop loss limit if you really want to ensure you walk away from the table with a bare minimum.

I bought AMD before the console wars (~$2/share) and turned $500 into $4000 by holding till last month before they started to drop. I threw another $500 on it at $12.22, it'll go back up in time. ",04-12-2017 16:01

2. Both AMD and TSM Today. Intel missed earnings and said it's delaying at least 6 months their 7nm chip. They were down like 18% last time I checked.

So, people are picking AMD as the current winner and growth potential, and TSM is likely the manufacturer to help Intel do their 7 nm chips, they already work with AMD and Apple.  That, and Apple moving to their chip design, using TSM,  and how much support the tech community is giving to AMD, how much shit Intel has been taking from them as well is the right equation, for now.

1. I am very bullish on AMD. I think it can be considered a growth, turnaround company, but that is depending on how it does next 2 Quarters.

I am Risky by buying in now, instead of later. 

I was just looking at Q3 earnings Transcript. Q/Q for this quarter is supposed to be down  15%, let's run some numbers to see what that means.

Q3 had a revenue of 1,640M. So -15% that means that Q4 will be 1,428M. Now compare 2017 Q4 vs 2016 (1,428M vs 1,106M) That is about 29% Gain. 

Now I doubt AMD anticipated Microsoft & Qualcomm win to happen this quarter. So that's another win. + Amazing sell on Ryzen on Black Friday, X360 Envy Laptop, and now Asus (Ryzen + Rx580) Laptop which is Sold Out online.

Reason to be Bearish is that ugly debt 1,700M! They show you their plan to reduce debt in a presentation. AMD explains their cash goal, Which to never go below 600M and the optimal goal is to have 1,000M. Currently, they are at 879M which a lot closer to their Optimal Goal Compared to there minimum. They are also using low-cost interest credit to pay higher interest ones.

1. Confidence in management, and a growing portfolio of competitive products, which they lacked for years!
2. I think its a little bit of both.

AMD is now competitive with Intel. Their high end cpu's for Servers are better (more cores) and cheaper than intel, and they are finally starting to see adoption (the Enterprise IT market moves at a snails pace a far as adoption goes) Combined with Intel's multiple vulnerabilities has a lot of high end IT looking at AMD, when just a year or two ago, would never have happened.
3. This move didn't happen in just a couple months.  Look at the consolidation from February 2017 to April 2018, that's 14 months.  And before that was a great run from April 2016.  Look back to then to find what has fundamentally changed.
4. Looks like history will repeat itself. It will go to $40 again. Now I wonder if it will stay there or crash back to $20?
5. Confidence in Mgmt. They will blow out either Q3 or Q4 earnings. ",12-09-2018 17:16

Intel planned to announce Monday a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip is intended for laptops that are thin and lightweight but powerful enough to run high-end videogames—attributes that lately have been driving sales in an otherwise waning market for personal computers.

Intel Corp. INTC -1.61% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., AMD 2.49% archrivals for decades, are teaming up to thwart a common competitor, Nvidia Corp. NVDA 1.34%

Intel planned to announce Monday a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip is intended for laptops that are thin and lightweight but powerful enough to run high-end videogames—attributes that lately have been driving sales in an otherwise waning market for personal computers.

It will be the competitors’ first collaboration since the 1980s, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy, and reflects complex shifting dynamics in the semiconductor industry.

For decades, Intel and AMD have scrapped for market share in PC chips. Intel has been dominant for much of that time, lately holding a nearly 100% share, according to Mercury Research. But AMD recently launched chips that represent the first real competition for Intel in that market for years.

AMD also recently revamped its graphics-chip designs, looking to take share away from Nvidia, which has nearly 80% of the market for stand-alone graphics chips by revenue.

Intel competes head-on with Nvidia in driving artificial-intelligence calculations for large internet companies. For several quarters, Nvidia’s business selling chips to data centers has been up by triple digits from the previous year, presumably displacing sales of Intel processors. Intel last year acquired technology to compete for that business with the purchase of Nervana Systems, and it expects those chips to start shipping by the end of the year.

Gaming PCs typically require both Intel processors and high-end graphics chips from AMD or Nvidia. Intel’s new product give it a shot at some of the revenue that usually goes to those graphics chips, while generating new sales for AMD and muscling in on Nvidia’s dominance in graphics units.

“Strategically, Intel is more comfortable competing with AMD than Nvidia,” Mr. Moorhead said. “They feel like they know what to do to compete,” so they can afford to cooperate to some degree.

An AMD spokesman said that laptops built on Intel’s new chip won’t compete directly with those based on AMD’s coming Ryzen Mobile, another power-efficient chip that combines general-purpose processing and graphics. The Intel chip will appeal to serious gamers, he said. The AMD unit, which the company expects to ship by the end of the year, is capable of running games, but not specialized for that purpose.


“We’re playing in a complementary market,” the spokesman said. said.
3. AMD's trading range still undefeated. Need to close above 12.01 to regain bullish sentiment
4. Market loves it. AMD is up 6%, INTC up 1%, and NVDA down 1% in the premarket.

h82432,stocks,"Post: Investing in AMD?

*Reposting this because I accidentally mentioned a forbidden app*

I’m very new to the stock market. I’ve been doing heaps of research the past month on how it works and how to make good investments. I know tech companies like AMD aren’t necessarily the best investments to make since things can go very wrong very fast. I also know it isn’t smart to invest based on emotion. So, I’m just asking for some advice and opinions.

I’ve been keeping up with gaming news a lot lately. Both Sony and Microsoft are using AMD processors and video cards in the next generation of consoles, which will definitely be very successful products. In addition, AMD processors are becoming the new standard in computers, and more major tech companies like Dell are starting to use AMD processors in their latest computers.

A gaming generation typically lasts 8 years-ish, and if AMD products are going to be the standard for this generation, I think things are going to start looking up for AMD.

I’m really thinking about investing in AMD as one of my first investments in addition to some ETF funds. I’m also looking for good long-term investments and I’m not too interested in day trading.

Thoughts? Criticisms? Am I just talking out of my ass? I still have a lot to learn, so anything helps!

Keep in mind I haven’t put any money into anything yet (I just opened up my back account a couple days ago). I know how risky stocks can be so I just want to make sure this is a good idea.

1. I bought AMD mid-2017 for around $10. Back then people were even more skeptical of AMD, the company is going bankrupt, they'll never beat Intel, Intel is too big to fail. 7nm is priced in. 

This was right after Zen 1 launched, they had roadmaps with Zen 2 being on 7nm. TSMC was already saying 7 nm will be 60% less power, 40% faster, 70% smaller. Intel had quad-cores 

To me it was obvious. Zen 2 launched on 7 nm end of last year and it was faster, more power efficient than anything Intel had and the stock is up 550%. 

imo AMD's stock has plateaued for too long and they have some huge stuff coming up that investors aren't accounting for. Consoles as you said, AMD already power the current gen Xbox/PS4 so console sales has always been their bread and butter, but sales will spike with a new generation being released. 

Intel has been even more incompetent than expected, they have absolutely nothing, they have their 14 nm node from 2011 that's now 14 nm++++, so many security vulnerabilities and they had to scrap their 10 nm node because they couldn't hit the clock speeds they wanted. They have a solid hold on the server market because servers and datacenters are planned 3-5 years into the future and AMD didn't exist 3 years ago. 

Consulting the chart, [https://www.techpowerup.com/img/t0L4aARlFfrFrsUb.jpg](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/t0L4aARlFfrFrsUb.jpg)

Zen 3 will be launching on N7+, Zen 4 is confirmed to be on 5 nm. After the Huawei export ban AMD made a deal with TSMC to take over all of Huawei's 5 nm supply and it's actually an insane amount of wafers AMD will be buying now. From being locked to GlobalFoundries and going through a bad breakup in 2019 that allowed AMD to see other foundries, AMD has become TSMC biggest customer with TSMC being the world's largest semiconductor company. Intel still runs their own fabs and there's just no way they can keep up with TSMC, as evident by their joke of a 10 nm node. 

AMD is already superior in every way for servers and market sentiment is shifting, Nvidia (AMD's main competitor) is in their DGX A100, AI compute server currently using AMD Epyc CPUs. If AMD's main competitor is picking them over Intel, it speaks volumes. 

As for AI, AMD is kinda nonexistent at the moment. AI is the fastest growing and most important market for AMD so that kinda sucks, Nvidia just has such a solid hold with CUDA and all the common machine learning python libraries only support CUDA, if you have a AMD GPU it won't run. However AMD is working on a solution to this and I think they will be able to offer something Nvidia will struggle to copy. 

In 2022-ish AMD will be launching Infinity Fabric gen 3 over PCIe 5.0, this will push bandwidths high enough to allow GPUs and CPUs to share unified resources, two 40 GB VRAM GPUs can be used as a single 80 GB GPU. Instead of copying the other GPUs memory into it's own memory the GPU will be able to just directly read memory stored on other GPUs. In their Zen CPUs AMD already does this with CPU cores all going through the infinity fabric to access memory, but the idea is to expand this outside the CPU. 

 [https://www.anandtech.com/show/15596/amd-moves-from-infinity-fabric-to-infinity-architecture-connecting-everything-to-everything](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15596/amd-moves-from-infinity-fabric-to-infinity-architecture-connecting-everything-to-everything) 

This is so huge for AI, those guy don't really care about performance as much as just amount of memory. You can always just train longer or train on more graphic cards. Double the VRAM and you can make a model twice as big, more complex, smarter. Currently most state-of-the-art models are around 1.5 billion parameters because that's around the biggest you can fit in 16 GB of vram (16 billion bytes), and bigger is always better. Connecting 8 GPUs together with unified resources and you got 8x the available VRAM.  

Nvidia has hacked together their own solution for this problem with the NVSwitch used in the DGX A100 previously mentioned, but it's an incredibly niche and expensive product. It's a separate piece of silicon you add to the board that's wired to each GPU and is basically a 100 W linking cable.  

 [https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/nvidia/nvswitch](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/nvidia/nvswitch) 

AMD will be able to do this but built into the architecture of the CPU+GPU so you just install 2 AMD GPUs and they will do this by default. For anyone not looking to buy a $199,000 DGX A100, they will be able to do something comparable on like a $20k AMD server. 

The world's fastest supercomputer at 2 exaflop will be using this technology from AMD and have CPU+GPUs linked together with gen 3 infinity fabric. 

AMD still has market cap of $63B while Intel is $251B, Nvidia $220B. Intel will get smashed, Nvidia is very competent so who knows. AI will need an insane amount of compute in the future and the market will only grow. 

For Nvidia gaming is growing at 27% year-over-year, data center is growing 80% y/y. Next quarter Nvidia will probably make more money from data than gaming, margins are also Waaay higher in data. AMD's stock price is driven by data center and AI, gaming and consoles has stopped being the main focus of their business, just so you know what you're actually investing in. Data center is looking great though, machine learning has figured out the basics and are in the middle of the ""MAKE EVERYTHING BIGGER"" stage.

2. AMD is a solid and safe investment for the next 2-3 years and likely many more. That's about when we expect Intel to at least have something to compete.  But who knows they are looking rough.

To note.  They have already had fairly great gains over the last year already everyone already knows about amd in consoles among many other sectors.  AMD has been killing it.  So I wouldn't bet on it being a huge gainer from here but still a solid pick.
3. Tech companies are always overvalued when using traditional metrics to measure(p/e).  Don’t let that discourage you.  AMD still has a lot of growth left.  Who knows, it may be a 10 bagger
4. You're right in all of your estimations however the wider market has had all of this information for awhile now. AMD has skyrocketed from $2 to $50 in 4 years as a result of these recent innovations. They'll probably continue to grow at least somewhat but it's more likely to be slower now it's all 'priced in'.

I make a lot of dough from Qualcomm, and AMD i have also made alot of dough on AMD since last year ($10 (januar 2018) to current $28 ish). The rocket still has alot of fuel. This will be an epic money machine people should not miss out!

1. Intel earnings show clearly some weakness. Numbers do not lie. AMD took alot from them outselling on comsumers market 2-1. Amazon, Microsoft, Google etc. has increase AMD offering in Datacenter. Microsoft have no problem increase datacenter, that means AMD took the % on marketshare with old tech. So AMDs Q2-Q3-Q4 will hammer Intel really hard.
2. READ Intel SEC filings. They wrote AMD is a Threat. Their last CEO said its his job to keep AMD under 20 % (current 5 % i predict 10 % already and 25-35 % by end of year).
3. Intel somehow thinking that they can buy time and still tell us that 10nm is coming and on schedule. Its like telling you that star citizen will be realease soon. Its just a fake PR stunt. Low volume and nothing for show.
4. Intel Can not compete until 2022!
5. AMD will be able to produce and out price Intel. Intel will keep priced and not lower much since they lose profit and  margins. But you can only for so long fool people. Companies also thinking alot about their cost and saving money from AMD is no brainer.
6. Notice all the AMD notebook. Super computers wins. And more cloud offerings from the cloud providers. Intel manage to ""fake news"" they cant meet demand is very fake news. They made so many bad decisions and do not know what to do. All over the place.

If Intel can pull it off and take significant marketshare for high-end processors away from competitors, it will be a tremendous accomplishment.

ftfy. If you were investing, you'd understand that ""time in the market > timing the market"" and would be holding AMD for as long as you feel they are fundamentally doing right. If you bought AMD as an ""investment"" but didn't believe their turnaround was real, then you entered into a foolish position. 

If you are trying to trade, you better learn how to read a chart and understand volume, RSI, MACD, etc.

They went from Wall Street assuming they would go bankrupt to launching 7nm before the industry giants, redesigning a scalable architecture for their entire product portfolio and will be able to regularly renegotiate their wafer supply agreement and debt as they grow in profitability and scale of business. I have been long AMD for almost 2 years and a fan of the companies innovation for decades so funnily enough I'm biased.

I just finished my build using full amd parts for the first time ever.

1. Because Intel crapped the bed, AMD is again ahead on technology ( last time was when they introduced AMD64), and they also finally managed to compete with NVIDIA at some pricepoints.
2. I bought into AMD a few years ago at $6, I'm still holding. My original exit point was $15 when I bought in.. but after digging deeper, I decided to hold. My bullet points for why I think AMD still has plenty of Room to run.

1. AMD's Ryzen desktop CPU is finally competitive with Intel, at a lower price point.     
2. AMD Graphics cards are finally competitive with Nvidia in the Low and Mid level markets, and at a lower price.      

While both 1 and 2 are great feathers in the cap for AMD, it doesn't hold a candle to my real reason....

- AMD's EPYC server CPU

When the original EPYC launched, it offered many more cores than a comparable intel server CPU, at about half the cost. The new EPYC chips, due to launch in the next month (code name Rome) will launch a 64 core/ 128 thread CPU for about $5k. Compare this to intels best offering of 28 core / 56 thread, for almost $10k, and its a no brainer for anyone building a new data center.       

In 2017, AMD held a 0.8% market share in the Datacenter market, Currently they are at about 4%, and are projected to be over 10% by the end of 2020. (Personally, I think that 10% number is low). While Desktop CPU's and GPU's are fun to talk about, the REAL money is in the Datacenter market. Combine this with the recent Intel vulnerabilities. AMD is poised to take a ton of market share from Intel.
3. Because reddit is full of teenagers. 

Why do you think the top stocks talked about here are weed and video game stocks?

5. AMD employs a different strategy compared to competitors. It actually provides value to its customers versus price gauging competitors, and people are finally catching on that AMD’s products are actually really good.

There has always been a stigma in the industry that AMD’s products weren’t as good as their competitors due to older product offerings (pre Lisa Su era); the whole “AMD is for poor people,” but it’s really been the stewardship of Su who is shedding the company of that mantra. AMD doesn’t offer cheaper products because its products have lower performance; it offers them at reasonable prices to give their customers value.",11-07-2019 12:41

In an older thread I got ridiculed stating that I think AMD will reach $95 - probably late Novemberish.

I see that still on track. I post this to kinda jab at the naysayers who probably think AMD is going to go up right now.

But usually when a stock - over a period of a month - does nothing but make lower-highs and lower-lows...that's called a down trend and the fact that SOME DAYS it goes up is irrelevant unless you're a swing trader trading off an oscillator.

I also love schooling those noobs who say I'm wrong. Let's bet money on it. You buy now - and tell me how well your position is doing late November.

I'll put that against my 61% annualized compounding return.

But if my cockiness is too over-bearing and you want some better proof then here:

Intel hasn't been this low since 2014; AMD and Nvidia are massive chip makers as well that will continue to produce. Even if these companies continue to slip up, on a long enough time frame, is there any substitute for these companies?

3. No reason to think they will recovery before the end of year.  The market ""should"" turn around when the Fed signals that the end of interest rate hikes is approaching.  But that is not going to happen any time soon.
4. I think you're right that chips are here to stay but you're not touching on what's going on right now. These companies have some pretty bad headwinds coming up with a possible global recession but the biggest thing that you need to think about is the everything bubble.

The low interest rates over the last however many years inflated everything, especially during covid. Look at Nvidias P/E, do you think that's under valued?

I'm long NVIDIA and have been since march 2020 with a couple of shares pre split and while I think they have a bright future i'm personally not choosing to add anymore in the mean time, even with the pull back.
5. Chips and cloud computing are amazing investment choices throughout this downturn.

They’re bound to eventually recover for the same reasons they were good investments before the bear market, but they’re also poised to explode with the inevitable move from phones to AR wearables over the next 5-10 years. People haven’t priced in the sheer increase in data transfer volume that will be required when digital interfaces will be overlaid over essentially everything in population centres in the next decade.

Qualcomm in particular has their hands in the mobile chip market and is at a great valuation right now.",07-10-2022 22:17
hy3mgo,investing,"Post: Why is Intel losing to AMD & people just realized it now?

Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)

When you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electrical engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?

Intel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map & product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.

This also separates the difference between value investing & growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.

There will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues & earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.

1. Intel’s lead architect left a few weeks ago - supposedly to join AMD (which is where he was prior to Intel anyway).

There was a good post on wsb a few weeks back about it - obviously there’s a lot of speculation, but it’s plausible.

Also, AMD have been gaining on Intel in terms of performance, power and heat. That said, Intel is still a household name, and they have a very aggressive marketing and licensing strategy. For example, Lenovo’s flagship X line of laptops are Intel-only, but they’re supposedly just waiting for that agreement to expire before moving on to AMD (I’d kill for an ARM X1 though :)
2. For 8 years, I worked at Intel as an electrical engineer designing circuits for the future manufacturing processes that Intel would be releasing 2-4 years into the future. There are literally thousands of MS and PhD engineers working on the myriad of challenges involved in making better computer chips. All the way from the design of the manufacturing tools, the amount of NAND gates in a library, the modeling and forecasting of dozens of transistor parameters, writing and supporting the simulation tools, to what I was doing designing and testing: analog circuits in a not yet stable manufacturing process. And hundreds of other challenges that each had teams from a few to a few dozen engineers trying to solve them. It's an insanely complex task. Most engineers working on any of these tasks are so specialized that they don't have any idea how to do the job of the engineers sitting a few aisles over. These engineers are 5-9 management layers below the CEO. Other companies operate the same way, it's just how chip design is done. 

Intel's main advantage over the last few decades was that it continuously had the most advanced manufacturing process, maintaining a 1-2 year lead over its closest competitors. However over the last ten years, TSMC has caught up and now overtaken Intel. This is mostly due to Intel's engineering struggles with it's last few manufacturing processes. These things spend half a decade in planning and development. Decisions were made years ago that they are now stuck with. 

Your points are all about top level management and I'm sure there's some truth to how important the CEO's decisions are, but I think Intel's current problems are primarily engineering problems with the manufacturing process. I sincerely doubt it's for lack of investment by CEOs. I think it's more likely that TSMC had better engineering talent and was able to do things more creatively that ended up wildly successful.  And surely some luck there too.

AMD has been doing well with their architectures recently and they should get credit for that, but their architectures were always quite good, the thing holding them back was their process and what had been a disadvantage, with TSMC, is now a huge advantage. They are poised to take market share, but they mostly have TSMC to thank for that.

4. Intel is also losing to arm, nvidia, qualcom and apple.
5. This entire narrative is BS. First, AMD has a fraction of the market share of Intel. Second, this is the third time AMD is about to overtake Intel, as if, it never happens. Check the long term charts. Third, Intel’s supposed 10nm process is actually a closer match to TSMC’s 7nm process already. Sizes don’t correspond to physical measurements. 

Is Intel hurting right now? Sure. But the biggest factors for it hurting aren’t the delay in process but two other things: the recession and the shrinking x86 market. 

Guess what, neither of those benefit AMD.",26-07-2020 08:49

[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html?.tsrc=rss):

>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

>The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

A more technical breakdown can be found from the [DOE's lab's website](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-argonne-national-laboratory-and-hewlett-packard-enterprise-prepare-for).

To be clear, the Intel deal is merely delayed, but not canceled. How does this change the narrative of Nvda/AMD versus Intel in the high-end server and super computer space? Are these kind of delays very common? I.E It's not a big deal.

Or did Intel just messed up a very visible and prestigious deal that will accelerate nvda/amd's surge to capture Intel market share?

*edited to add* [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-amd-polaris-supercomputer-department-of-energy) also interpreted the DOE's purchase of the Nvidia-AMD machine as being caused by Intel's delay.

2. Talking to my valley friends, this is the same reason Apple switched to ARM. Intel have proven themselves incapable of meeting their deadlines. Their customers are getting tired of it.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't invest in Intel but one thing that's very important to keep in mind is what Intel excels at is support. When you buy Intel hardware for your server farm they are there to help you at every step with whatever problem you encounter. AMD's support is substantially poorer. One of the reasons Intel has stuck around, and will probably continue to stick around, is they offer top-tier support. That's not important for the individual intel processor buyer, but it's a big deal for people building super computers, server farms, etc. A real deal-clincher.
3. It is not ""because"" though. They are separate purchases and not replacement of each other.

l0hxe5,investing,"Post: AMD: Undervalued at $90

AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.

&#x200B;

**Intel struggles**

Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)

&#x200B;

**AMD Q4 and FY**

EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.

&#x200B;

**2021&2022 Outlook**

But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.

&#x200B;

**Booming Market**

Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.

it176s,investing,"Post: Sony reduces PS5 production by 26.7% due to AMD chip issue

 According to Bloomberg, there is a low yield issue with the SOC chip in PS5 (as low as 50% yield). As the result, Sony will have to cut its PS5 production by 26.7%. As we know, AMD provides those SOC chips (custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and custom GPU based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture), and those chips are manufactured with TSMC 7nm process.

Since AMD's upcoming Zen 3 and Big Navi also use TSMC 7nm, will there be yield issue for Zen 3 and Big Navi too? Probably yes.

Will this cause AMD and TSMC stocks to drop? Maybe.

If we keep seeing news like this coming out in the next few weeks, obviously it's not good for any of these companies. So take this into consideration for your next play - don't just YOLO thinking the market has finally turned around.

1. First time?

&#x200B;

AMD up 15% tomorrow.
2. Sounds like a rumour to increase early sales for PS5 or stock manipulation.

**Why is this unlikely?**

TSMC 7nm has a very good yield. Defect density was 0.09 9 month ago. As it is constantly improving, I assume 0.07 now.

Lets assume ps5 die is similar size to xbox die. (no exact info on ps5 die online)

Input all values into the wafer calculator here:

[https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/](https://caly-technologies.com/die-yield-calculator/)

This results in a yield of 80.5%. Add some partial functions dies as well, as usually console chips have  some redundant compute units to increase yield. So between 80.5 and 85% yield.

Even if we make it 20% larger than xbox die, we wont even come close to 50% yield.

To drop below 50% yield, the defect density must be 0.23 which is not the case for 7nm.

I see no technical reason why it should be 50% yield. The article also provides no explaination why yield should be that horrible on a mature node with low defect density. They are not even trying.

Maybe any electrical engineer can chime it, if there are other reasons why yield could be that horrible on a mature node besides defect density and die size?
3. TSM up 1.13% currently in Taiwan. Seems to have no effect as of today.
4. According to the article I read on a Japanese website, this reporter is very low credibility. Actually, he was banned by some Japanese game firm because of his report.For people who understand Japanese:

https://ha-navi.com/wsj-nin
5. AMD has had no problems with yield, and TSMC N7 is yielding 80%+.

If this report is true, and Xbox has no equivalent problems, I suspect it might be something to do with Sony's custom IO? Their much-hyped SSD loading times rely on CPU decompression heavily, and iirc they designed the IO chip that goes in the SoC themselves.",15-09-2020 03:54

I have a broad portfolio and have been holding AMD since around $14.

1. no one has crystal ball, let me recommend voo to you
2. Imho, The biggest threat to AMD right now isn't Nvidia...it's what's going on with the ARM processors beyond what started out as good mobile processor. Apple blazed the trail by successfully showing what a well developed ARM processor could do beyond just the iPhone and into now laptops and now heavier weight desktop and server...
The latest M4s are looking pretty good  and apple has successfully decoupled from x86.
Windows has no choice but to embrace ARM and decouple from X86. 

For mobile computing, before it was acceptable to tradeoff raw computing power for battery consumption, hence why ARM SOCs were preferred.. but now that performance gap is closing.  Qualcomms latest batch of snapdragon processors might actually gain some footing now too with the Snapdragon X Elite finding its way into laptops ....and this is going to pave the way for Samsung to follow  too with Exynos processors beyond mobile phones. I've worked with them before and they always wanted into in-source their own ARM processor into all their computing devices, it just wasn't as good as Qualcomms and probably still isn't.  This is also going to open the door for lower tier players like MediaTek to sell their ARM processor into the computing space. They companies need to do this because the growth of mobile phones has been stagnant so these companies need to find another channel to sell their products to.. so it's happening in the computing space. These don't need to be the fastest and most powerful laptops they just have to be ""good enough"" for the average consumer ...with emphasis on better power consumption. The average consumer is not a power user unlike some of us geeks.

So the competition for AMD has gotten much stiffer on the personal computing space because they aren't just going to be competing against Intel and Nvidia but also all of the previous mobile chip companies that made a decent SOC that can repurpose it for a laptop or desktop and eventually a server.


Windows 11 can run just fine with an ARM processor so this could pose a long term issue to the x86 architecture.


Server/enterprise side will take more time so that isn't as big a threat....

That said, I'm still an long term AMD shareholder. Because the few shares I kept all the back to $3.50/share shortly after Dr. Lisa Su took the helm...so for me, I really can't lose......but these days I'm camping more out in TSM and SOXL.

Everyone uses TSM, even Intel is using TSM now for part of their chip fab


Now....If I only held converted those 30 AMD call options with a $10 strike price back then instead of selling them when AmD hit $50 ....and also held onto my  Nvidia shares purchased at $50ish...... and have kept all my employer issued Qualcomm stock and  later, my employer issued Broadcom stock too before Avago took over ...but oh no , play it safe they said... take profit they said....keep stock that pays a dividend they said....why the fuck did I listen and keep this POS deadhorse Intel instead.... for someone that was very much part of ground 0 in the semi industry, I have to say , I blew it.......Goodbye McLaren P1, hello pre-owned 570s. Oh well shit happens...my therapist says I should not look back for my mental health.......🤣🤣🤣🤣
3. AMD should be a good one to keep. They have a far better technique to build their Chips than their direct adversary Intel and a good relationship with the current marketmaker NVDA. NVDA will shift their focus more and more towards data Centers and AI, freeing up portions of the markets AMD and Intel are in and with no doubt in my mind, at this point AMDs products are favored over Intels and will give AMD the opportunity to take over the CPU market for example.
4. I still buy an amd processor for my gaming PC tho
5. I'll say this as non-investment advice, more business. Nvidia is controlling the sector right now. They can pretty much price their product anyway they want. AMD is the closest competition. Nvidia customers want AMD to succeed and others to succeed. 10-20 years from now the AI landscape will be completely different.

2. This is going to be roughly $35 billion worth of AMD stock. That's about 1/3 of AMD's market cap. I can't even remember the last time I knew of a company acquiring another company for such a huge amount of money, relative to their own market cap.

Is this an arbitrage opportunity or I’m missing some risk factor here?

Edit: I’ve overlooked that this is an all-share deal and AMD share price is down pre-market.

How do we feel about AMD at the moment? 

AMD 5800x3D processors are in short supply, 5700x3Ds are taking over. Many people switching from NVDA to AMD GPUs because of price to performance.  It feels like at least in the gaming community, AMD is having a bit of a surge.  

Obviously NVDA is more than just a gaming company, I've just seen a lot of people joining the AMD side lately.

Top Comments:
1. The consumer side is such a small part of what these companies do now it doesn't really matter. Unless we got a 2016/17 type of market swing where a company comes back from the brink of death it's mostly whatever.
2. AMD is an excellent company, but consumer side is an increasingly minor part of both AMD, NVIDIA and Intel for that matter. 

However, they are getting freebies from poor management of Intel and price-creep that NVIDIA is placing on consumers, which *will* eventually price out even wealthy consumers. 

I can see them taking market shares from Intel on the cpu side if they continue their current performance per watt, and if they can find a way bridge the feature-gap that they currently have with NVIDIA on the GPU side.
3. It's hard to fight the existing CUDA but AMD still stands a chance in the AI segment, if anything you'll have slow steady growth, and that's never a bad thing.
4. AMD is also more than just a gaming company.

Both Nvidia and AMD make only a fraction of their revenue in the gaming market.

Both are printing money with data center products. The gaming community has only a very small influence on the stock price.

162qftl,investing,"Post: How far behind Nvidia is AMD?

From what I’ve read, Nvidia’s only real competitors, for now, are AMD and Intel. Intel handles manufacturing, whereas AMD is fabless like Nvidia, so AMD is a much closer competitor in terms of business model and product offering.

Admittedly, I am pretty unfamiliar with the technical elements of semiconductors, but I understand demand for AMD chips is nowhere close to that of Nvidia’s, and market share in advanced chips will be skewed toward Nvidia for at least a few years.

Those of you with a better understanding of chip tech and the semiconductor industry: Is it likely just a matter of time before AMD catches up, or is there something fundamental missing from AMD’s products that puts Nvidia ahead for the foreseeable future?

Top Comments:
1. AMD made room for itself in the CPU world for both gaming and servers but remains gaming oriented for GPU.

The company is considerably smaller than its competitors, when you are the underdog you can't fight all wars.
2. AMD is good for gaming. Nvidia is good for gaming and rules in AI where the real money is. AMD's big business is selling processors to MS and Sony for their game consoles. They are in different markets and the boxed GPU's are a small part of the market
3. In the enterprise/research space NVIDIA's CUDA platform is the market leader will be for many years. AMD and Intel really don't have anything that competes right now as far as market adoption.
4. With Mosaic basically leveling the CUDA playing field and AMD buying Mipsology, I wouldn't be so sure Nvidia will have the same chokehold on ML/AI in the near future. 

https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/amd-mi250
5. AMD is competing with Intel in the CPU market and seems to be taking the lead. With Nvidia AMD competes in the GPU market (Intel GPU attempts are negligible) and on the hardware side AMD is nearly as good as Nvidia. For gaming for the same price you can get equally good products from both. Where AMD is lacking is the software that supports use of their GPUs in data centres, machine learning and generally AI field. Nvidia is entrenched with their software and even if AMD sells equally good hardware the cost of switching to a different software architecture (which also may be not as good at the moment) will be prohibitive. Until AMD solves this problem Nvidia will be the leader.",27-08-2023 13:28

AMD is down roughly 15% as of right now. I currently just bought $2000 worth. It's possible it could go down further. However, I think it being down 15% is a good buy-in price. I think it is a better buy/value as of right now compared to Nvidia. This isn't me trashing Nvida still a good a stock just I believe AMD is a better buy as of this moment. Thoughts on this move?

2. I've rode this AMD rollercoaster before ... Plays with my emotion too much.
3. this is gambling not investing

you don’t talk about fundamentals or anything lmao. just number go down but i think number go up..!

there is a perspective that both of the stocks you are talking about have horrible buy to return ratios and you’re chasing gains but it’s your money.
4. I sort of think it's a fallacy to price anchor to a previous price

The historical price of a stock really should not matter, is it a good buy at the current price?

A stock rising or falling 15-20-30% really has no relevance on if it's a good value today.  
So in a vacuum, just knowing a stock rose or fell 25% really tells you nothing if the current price is a good value or not.

With a current PE of over 100 there is a lot of growth priced in, if the market is pricing in 30% growth and it only grows 25% there is still room for it to fall even though seemingly it's growing at a good rate.

I missed last year's incredible bull run in a lot of tech. I played the options market more and held cash. Now I'm looking for decent value holds. AMD's most recent earnings blowout has me pretty exciting that they're living up to the hype. As far as I can see their P/E was basically cut in half after their report last week. That, plus the fact that their stock has been dropping ever since makes me think this is an excellent dip to buy.

4. *\*\*\*Disclosure: I have roughly $30,000 invested in AMD so my opinion might be biased.* 

Personally, I think it is a great time if any to invest in AMD. Main reason why is that recently the stock saw a dip from the 100 down to the mid 80s level mostly due to hedge funds deleveraging because of the whole GME fiasco so you are buying it at a discount in my opinion. 

Another reason why is that AMD is a classic turnaround story. It wasn't too long ago that the company was on the verge of bankruptcy due to failing product lines, but now it has CPUs that can rival and even outperform Intel and the specs for their GPUs shows they can actually go foot to foot with Nvidia. 

Also, keep in mind that the market for CPUs and GPUs are still growing so I don't really expect a deceleration of the company's revenue growth. 

Lastly, keep in mind that the Gov is still doing QE infinity, that and the trillions of stimulus they are gonna give out this year means it is a perfect environment for risk assets, so don't overthink it.
5. I got in around $40 and I am holding with my fingers crossed. It seems like they are competitive with NVIDIA and NVIDA's stock price is insane. Intel has made too many mis-steps and they have a lot of dead wood stifling innovation.

4. From [Seeking Alpha](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3724985-xilinx-deal-spread-with-advanced-micro-devices-widens-to-highest-ever):

The deal spread between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had widened to $65/share, or about 45%, the highest since the deal was announced in October. Xilinx fell 3.7%, while AMD rose 5.9%. Several other technology deals that also need Chinese antitrust approval also saw their spreads widen today.

One reason for Xilinx's (XLNX) move down may be that risk arb investors can't handle the potential downside for Xilinx (XLNX) if a deal with AMD (AMD) were to fall apart as AMD's shares continue to rocket higher, according to CNBC's David Faber. CNBC's Jim Cramer also said he believed that AMD (AMD) has become a meme stock at this point. AMD shares have jumped almost 25% in the past two weeks.

In addition a Dealreporter column from last night may be contributing to weakness in the spreads. The opinion piece points out that China's leaders appear to have changed their tone about the importance of technology in late May and may have put the country on a ""technology war footing."" The U.S. and South Korean's announcement to fund multi-billion dollar semiconductor factories may also have contributed to China's potential slowdown on approving the U.S. deals.

As far as Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) planned purchase of Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM), the Dealreporter column says the timing is uncertain. Last month traders circulated a report that the timing for Chinese approval had moved out as some customer have issues with export controls, though the deal was still likely to be approved.

Risk arb investors may also be ""de-risking"" due to heightened antitrust risk after Aon (NYSE:AON) and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) abandoned their $30B deal last week after the U.S. sued to block the deal and after a report from The Information last night that the U.S. DOJ is considering filing a lawsuit to block UnitedHealth's planned $8B purchase of Changed Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG).

Last month MLex reported that the AMD's (AMD) purchase of Xilinx (XLNX) is expect to see a Phase Two review by Chinese antitrust regulators. China's State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR is believed to have reached out to industry participants a few months ago to find out their views on market definitions and market shares.

Other deal spreads that are wider today include Maxim (MXIM)/Analog Devices (ADI) and Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR)/II-VI(NASDAQ:IIVI).

Also last week it was reported that China's review of Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) planned purchase of Arm Holdings (ARMHF) was said to be delayed. China's antitrust regulatory hasn't started its formal review of the deal for Softbank to sell Arm to Nvidia, according to a report from The Information.

https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/for-the-first-time-ever-amd-outsells-intel-in-the-datacenter-space

> AMD's datacenter segment revenue reached $3.549 billion in the third quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter and AI group's earnings were $3.3 billion in Q3 2024. Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins.
> 
> It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales. However, Intel still has to ramp up production of its Granite Rapids products.

lb4nrp,investing,"Post: Why I believe AMD sees an All Time High in the coming months

AMD was another stock targeted in Robinhood's restricted stock list late last week. This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.

Robinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.

There are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))

Along with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.

AMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.

The one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.

Hope this is all helpful!  

Disclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.

1. Is this why AMD is up 5% pre-market?

**Edit:** I just realized that they're making a new chip, not a laptop with Intel CPU and AMD GPU. This is actually a huge deal. Interested to see what comes of it.
2. Just as Ryzen was getting started.

I've got mixed feelings about this. On the surface, partnerships seem like a good idea for obvious reasons. The two companies basically get benefits from not competing with each other.

On the other hand, recent months have AMD's ""Ryzen"" CPU has been getting a lot of positive press, while AMD's ""Vega"" GPU has been somewhat lackluster compared to NVidia's Pascal. (Mostly because ""Vega"" came months later but not much better than Pascal in video games).

With that said, Intel's integrated graphics are utter shit. So anything is an improvement on that matter. Ultimately, it seems like Intel gets the better end of this deal: AMD's Ryzen CPU is the strong part of its company right now, while the graphics are the weaker part.

----------

From a long-term play perspective: Tablets and ""Ultrabook"" lightweight laptops are the most commonly sold PC devices today. So it seems like AMD is going for a marketshare strategy. The more users AMD gets on its graphics architecture, the better optimizations AMD will get (in theory) from developers.

So perhaps AMD's strategy here isn't so much to make money, but to establish a better platform to better benefit from the ""free development"" from Video Game designers. Video Game programmers are already targeting AMD's GCN / GPU architecture because of XBox One and PS4. To add (some) Intel Laptops into the mix will only make AMD's platform a better pick for programmers to choose.

Historically, NVidia's chips seem to have more optimizations due to better documentation (ie: books like ""GPU Gems"") and more blogposts on the subject.

lqfhuz,investing,"Post: Technology stocks are crashing – what now

A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.

17yaktc,investing,"Post: 7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k

I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.

1cyvquh,investing,"Post: Where do You see AMD One Year from Today???

Obviously no one knows, but it would be interesting to see what public opinion is for Nvidia's little brother. Do you think it can pass 200 in a year, or are we stuck to floating around 140-160? Nvidia is doing insane things on a daily basis, but idk if that will continue to positively affect AMD. Maybe it will cause AMD to drop if they can't keep up? Intel has a habit of never moving an inch, even with good news, so will AMD continue a similar pattern in the next year?

1. I don’t know but I am still buying AMD and INTC whenever they fall near/below my average cost.
2. **Pros:** Great pedigree. Strong IP portfolio. Wonderful success story of how savvy management bet on new chip architectures to take market share from Intel. Its Epyc CPUs are in high demand for cloud compute. Unlike Intel, which has floundered in the GPU segment, AMD has a GPU business that is accretive to earnings. 

**Cons:** Narrow moat. Competitive threats on both sides of the business: Epyc CPUs are seeing increasing threats from ARM-based datacenter processors. Microsoft is partnering with Lenovo, Samsung, and other OEMs to launch Qualcomm/ARM-based laptops. AMD is getting absolutely trounced by Nvidia in the GPU segment. AMD has taken leadership from Intel in many ways, but Nvidia is the final boss that AMD has yet to get past.

I don't speculate. I just hold VTI and own my share of AMD, NVDA, INTL, etc. through a total market index. ymmv.

2. I'm all for having a strong and competitive AMD but all of you idiots who think they will be dominating the desktop CPU market are clearly underestimating Intel. It's obvious Intel has been sand bagging IPC gains on their chips due to a lack of competition in the market. If Ryzen is as good as it's looking to be, Intel will undoubtedly respond by 1) lowering their prices and 2) releasing a competitive product. Intel spends more money on R&D than AMD is worth as a company. It's absolutely absurd to think they won't respond with fire to a competitive AMD.

Top Comments:
1. Bought in at $2.82 back in the day. Should have bought more. :(
2. People were saying $20 in mid to late 2017 after Ryzen hit and EPYC was released, which was complete horseshit.  The stock has done amazing, largely because Intel has just continued to screw up their 10nm fab.  Hype is getting higher around AMD again at this point and it's going to be trading at a P/E of 40-50 in the 20+ range based on earnings expectations for this year with significant risk going forward as Intel still has yet to appoint a new CEO and the cryptomining market continues to cool and weighs on earnings in the back half of the year.

The fact of the matter is AMD themselves didn't expect to perform this well, which is why they issued equity around $8 share back in 2018 and warrants as part of their GF contract at around the same price.

I think just about everyone with somewhat anchored expectations has been surprised by how favorably things have gone for AMD, even their own management.
3. And has given me my largest return at 94%. I hope it can continue, but I’m always a skeptic
4. As someone who is long on AMD, there's still far more upside.  They are stealing server marketshare from Intel right and left.  Their products are more futureproofed than nVidia's and tend to improve with age, so in the long term they offer a solid value to consumers for the long run.  Recent HDR benchmarks prove that.  

Freesync is a totally undervalued aspect of AMD growing their business, Samsung has adopted it for their high end TV's, pretty much everyone who makes a monitor is making monitors that make use of it.  Sony will probably introduce TVs that utilize it prior to release of the PS5.

Semi-custom.  AMD has Sony and Microsoft game consoles.  

AMD is also making the jump to the 7nm process.  Their market cap to me is extremely low given there's only a handful of companies that can produce these types of products, and both major players (Intel and nVidia) are worth far more.

2. Isn't AMDs technology superior to Intel which is the cause for it being ""undervalued"". AMD will take their market share and cause Intel to go bankrupt if they can't catch up. Even large companies can be surpassed.
3. Intel is not the clear winner. Intel vs AMD/Nvidia are just different investment plays regardless whichever you think is the superior technology. They are not comparable.

Intel yoy EPS and revenue growth is stagnant. So what you see is what you get. We have a good idea of what their cagr will be. We know the dividends that will be paid. It is somewhat fairly valued.

AMD/Nvida yoy EPS and revenue growth is 50%-100%. So cagr, growth, returns are difficult to predict. Its rolling the dice on whether they can maintain, beat, or miss the expected growth rate.. the expectation is built into valuation and share price.
4. The reality is that folks are seeing a lot of promise in ARM-based microarchitectures vs. x86; this is the canonical AMD vs. Intel comparison. For multi-core CPU computing, there is a lot of research interest in what AMD is doing. Probably a few years before the private sector interest gets with the program. 

On the other hand, AMD has a proven track record in GPUs. I know Intel is releasing their first GPU next year (?), but Xeon Phi was such a laughing stock professionals will need serious convincing. AMD can actually give Nvidia a run for its money here, and their recent partnership with a forge is promising.
5. Intel has been growing their fcf at about 9% a year going back 10 or 11 years (don't remember how far back I went.) Gross profit, earnings, revenue, etc.. are also growing, so the ""dying company"" argument has no merit. Obviously not a dying industry either. My projections, which were lower than analysts projections, have you more than doubling your money in the next 10 years if you bought the entire company outright, then of course you'd still own the company after that.

Lots of nonsense about them losing the apple contract. Apple is 1-3% of their revenue depending on the year. With the current demand, they can EASILY make that up like it didn't even happen.

New ceo was their cto before they started losing market share. He stopped being the technology officer just a few years before they really started losing market share. He's now the CEO and focusing on improving production and product quality and they're already putting more money into those in his first few months in charge.

More cash on hand than AMD has done in revenue their last 3 years combined, so they have plenty of money to put into improving product and production quality.

New facilities within the U.S. is also good given the current party in office and our horrible supply chain. I bought shares this week. Want to increase my position, but looking to get in under $54, and ideally under $50.",28-05-2021 21:21

I have a watchlist of 8 tech stocks and I was comparing the P/E ratios.  I see AMDs is largely out of place @ 1,084.39.  The other 7 (APPL, NVDA, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT) and on average their P/E ratio is 48 (26:78).

So what gives?  Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?

edit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!

Top Comments:
1. I see several wrong answers here, so I’ll chime in. AMD is a profitable company but spent a massive chunk of change on the acquisition of Xilinx.

I’m no accountant, but I’d imagine that $50B acquisition is being put on their balance sheet as an expense and that’s making their P/E look so wild. 

Can an accountant weigh in here?
2. P/E means nothing when you just released the best product (MI300 AI card) in a market expected to grow to 400B annual revenue in 2027, while having just 22B in revenue (current AMD annual revenue).

Use P/E only to evaluate mature companies in mature markets.
3. AMD is devouring massive chunks of Intel’s market, and making good progress in GPU. There’s a lot more to a stock price than P/E.
4. The stock market is trading future expectations and AMD has delivered strong growth in revenue the last years.

https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/amd/financials/

The trailing PE ratio is 1,189.55 and the forward PE ratio is 39.31. 
AMD has completed its $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx.

A look at their latest numbers.

In the fourth quarter of their 2022 fiscal year, Xilinx generated 600 million U.S. dollars in revenue, the only quarter to be reported by AMD as a separate entity before the company's operations were incorporated into other AMD business segments.

A look at their past reports shows that there is a potential of a 1000 million quarterly profit.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1184120/xilinx-quarterly-revenue-worldwide/

With a forward P/E below 40 AMD is certainly not a bargain, but regarding the outlook not expensive either in my opinion.

What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

4uj10r,investing,"Post: NVIDIA is worth 500% more than AMD. AMD +10% today. What do you thing the ""rational"" NVIDIA/AMD market cap ratio is?



Top Comments:
1. AMD has a ton of debt and Nvidia has loads of cash on hand.  If Nvidia wanted to, they could start a price war and force AMD into losses.  Right now Nvidia is more worried about upstream companies like ARM and INTEL than downstream companies like AMD.

Nvidia is trying to carve out a new business with AI, Machine Learning, and autonomous cars.  AMD is trying to pay off debt and make headway into low cost APU servers.

I don't think these two companies should trade equally, but I think that robo traders are using the two stocks similarly for now as part of tax loss harvesting.  I think when the bull rush finishes on GPU companies AMDs stock will suffer much more than Nvidia's.
2. This post is how idiots lose a bunch of money on AMD.

""They do the same thing, and I like AMD better for some superficial reason, therefore AMD should be worth as much if not more than NVIDIA!""

3. Holding both long.  I see more growth in AMD for a little while before stock drops again, still keeping my $10 target.  Nvidia has been doing well in my portfolio for a couple years now, I've upped my stake in them since their new 10 series gpu announcement. Price target for Nvidia is $70.  
4. Now that the 1060 is hitting the market, nvidia has things cinched up until we see AMD's Vega next year but big N has to clean their image up a bit. A small slice of the market still sees them as a company that loves to play dirty and pushes proprietary solutions at high-ish premiums.

Other than a somewhat minor image issue, nVidia is a pretty strong play. Their media box is doing really well despite being released over a year ago. They have deep learning, HPC, Volta, and more.

AMD really can't die. Their stock will bounce all over the place but the company won't go away thanks to their strategic patent and licensing positions.

If another chip company (like ARM) starts to grow past AMD, I could see trouble for big red and some major movement resulting in an x86 vs non-x86 market.
5. I am heavily invested in both of them. Is it stupid? Because they're competitors and if one wins, the other one's destined to lose. So it's a lose/lose for me, right? ",25-07-2016 15:02
g7cza6,investing,"Post: I lost 25% of my savings this week. Here is what I learned.

After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and ""hit it big"".

I spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in.

Tuesday morning was not fun.

Here's what I learned:

* **Don’t ever buy something you don’t FULLY understand.** On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world’s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn’t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn’t know that the real risk was that I didn’t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren’t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.
* **Don’t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank.** Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they've said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false: [https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png) I thought this meant that USO had to sell all those contracts and move into May contracts on Monday. I thought USO was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of. But that's not how this works.
* **The word “ETF” is used extremely loosely.** An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are “attempting to track daily movements of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. An ""ETF"" is just a fund. Don’t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.
* **Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there.** As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.
* **Don’t fuck around with leveraged ETFs.** In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF “HOU.to” at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn’t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can’t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn’t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.
* **Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything.** [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) \- which I purchased into - is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it’s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it’s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. Everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, yet millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.
* **The biggest lesson in these oil ETF’s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market.** A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.
* **Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now.** The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - it’s quite certain that there are “sub prime mortgage backed security” equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It’s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there.
* **Be careful.**

At least you weren't stupid enough to gamble it all.

Not to salt your wounds but ETF literally just means ""exchange traded fund"".  There is absolutely no characteristic of an ETF that should lead you to believe it tracks spot price. 

And the fund description quite literally says ""provides exposure to oil futures"" not oil spot price.

I think you understand now that you didn't understand what you were buying so I'm not gonna harp on that but I really want to hone in on the fact that the term ETF isn't being applied loosely here at all, you are just misunderstanding what an ETF is.  It's simply a legal structure to hold securities - nothing about that inherently implies tracking spot price.  Like I just think you shouldn't be making the perfectly accurate use of the word ETF here as some scapegoat, even in a limited sense.

eqobfr,investing,"Post: What’s with AMD

I don’t understand the hype with AMD. They’re literally trading at a 265 P/E and if you annualized their best quarter- I repeat their BEST, it would be ~120. Sure their growth is great but it does not justify their balance sheet. Additionally through a rough calculation I believe their EV/Operating cash flow ~ 1736.35. Can someone explain? I’m new to investing and would appreciate the help!

Top Comments:
1. AMD stock price explained by two things:

1. 10% of the price is their great  microarchitecture and multi-chip packaging  combined with  TSMC's prosess. 
2.  90% of the price is  Intel's failed 10nm process technology transition.  Intel dropped the ball and there is room for growth for AMD. 

AMD's market share 2019:

* Desktop      20%   
* Notebook    15% 
* Server          4%

AMD will grow market share  fast next few years. They are expected to more than double their server market share to something like 10% next year alone.  Their Forward P/E is 43.09, PEG Ratio next 5 years is 3.11.  Their success is  limited only by TMSC's capacity. They will win  most deals from Intel if they can deliver the chips. 

Intel took  calculated risk in their  attempt to get ahead without EUV lithography and it failed spectacularly. 

There is no reason to expect that Intel's next major process node tech  is failure but it takes several years. I fully expect Intel to be fully back within 5 years  with their  new process and packaging. Until it's ready, they are refining the existing process technology and losing market share.  AMD has few years to gain market share and grow into a big boy that takes on Intel as equal. 

The new lithography process  transition is always a risk. Intel made a misstep and Global Foundries quit the 7nm game.  TSMC or Samsung might fail in their next big process. AMD is now fully reliant on TSMC. 

(Btw. Names like 10nm and 7nm are just commercial names and not comparable between companies. 
Intel's 10nm is 100 million transistors per mm². TSMC's 7nm Mobile is 96 million transistors per mm²)

Summary: If you want to value  AMD, look at what happens between TSMC and Intel.
2. The hype behind AMD is that they are wiping the floor with Intel. If they can sustain and widen their edge they are set to grow massively. ~$220MM vs $19B revenue from Intel. It's practically a 100x increase if that were to outright flip. About a 35x increase if they steal half Intel's market. Their sales would expand from about $6B to $35 - 40B. Right now AMD's market cap is 1/5 that of Intel so if you fervently believe in AMD's story you're looking at a multibagger even from these elevated levels.

That said, if Intel gets control back AMD's stock is primed to lose like 90% of its value. So this is a very high risk high reward play. I like AMD's odds imo they have always done a lot with a little, and their partnership with TSMC is set to help them stay ahead of Intel with their foundry woes.
3. Is called market inefficiency. same story with tesla. The trick here is to find the opposite. Great company trading for cheap
4. The market doesn't price the stock much on what it did do, the price is what it is expected to do.

I haven't looked at AMD but looking at their past financials is somewhat worthless , stocks are not priced on the past but the future.

Investors think AMD will grow a lot , that is why the PE multiple is so high , investors are expecting very high growth
5. Few big things:

 new gen of consoles. Previous gen ps4 and xbox were released 7 years ago. Upcoming generation will support up to 8k and ray tracing - so it will even compete with PC. This is the year when many if not most people will upgrade consols.

Server chips - those will take huge chunk from intel. Being much cheaper, more powerful, and much less vulnerabilities like Spectre, Zombieload etc.

HPC - even Oak Ridge National Laboratory new gen supercomputer (the most powerful in the world) will be build by AMD 

Add to this  better than Intel desktop cpus, and recent release of mobile cpus - hence the valuation",18-01-2020 23:31
1191h6s,investing,"Post: Intel Cuts Dividend by a whopping 66%

https://www.barrons.com/articles/intel-cuts-dividend-6a2e1f03

>Intel announced Wednesday it will be cutting its quarterly dividend by 66%, saying the move “reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation.”

>Intel will be cutting its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a share , down 66% from its previous dividend of 36.5 cents.

>“The decision to decrease the quarterly dividend reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation and is designed to best position the company to create long-term value. The improved financial flexibility will support the critical investments needed to execute Intel’s transformation during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty,”  
 
I think Pat's direction is generally correct, slow down the financial manipulations while refocusing on becoming the best again, though there will be short term pain.  
 
As impressive as AMD's rise has been as someone who watched it as the forever struggling smaller competitor for many years, it's almost impressive that Intel competes this much stuck on a 10nm FF process at all. If they came back to fab leadership in 2025+? Who knows. Could even fabricate chips for former competitors like AMD and Nvidia.

2. Good. They need to reinvest into themselves and get my stock share prices back up 😂
3. Intel has become a car driven by accountants and lawyers. Look at the many years of share buybacks. Buybacks are a total waste of $$ to somehow maintain share prices.
Engineers/scientists invent new ways and new products. With superannuated dead heads running Intel it has no hope. Those $$ wasted on buybacks would have invigorated the company.
4. My last intel Pc was around 2011. Something changed in 2014-15 and when I built my current computer in 2017, I went AMD for the first time. My next Pc will probably be AMD as well. I think intel has a lot to overcome in the future.
5. Long time coming.  It's really hard to overstate just how badly Intel screwed up this 10nm node.  They went from having a massive advantage going into 14nm to falling way behind TSMC and even Samsung here.  That's basically all this comes down to, devoting far too many resources to trying to make 10nm work instead of accepting that it was a lost cause and working on getting the next node out on a decent timeline.

AMDs rise has been primarily due to the fact that Intel has just been screwing up for the last 5-7 years at this point on the fab side.  I mean they've pulled out all the stops to stay relevant at this point already by switching to their hybrid core design and even removing features that were particularly throttle prone like AVX-512 on the consumer side but the chips still run extremely hot and performance is kind of mixed at best.  They've pretty much given up on the HEDT market at this point too on the consumer side.

Really the biggest change recently has been that they've finally had to lower prices so people will continue buying their chips.  As much as people focus on AMD in the longer term the major threat is still other large non-semi tech names continuing to invest in their own designs and taking market share on the cloud services side with them.  Hell Apple has even moved M1 into their consumer laptops at this point.

I think the one plus is that they might actually be able to provide an effective counterweight to NVIDIA on the consumer GPU side in a few generations here.  AMD does fine on the silicon but their software is deficient pretty much across the board.  Another big problem is neither of these companies really compensate competitively relative to the emerging design competitiors in the cloud and consumer space (Apple, Amazon and Google all pay much better).

Hopefully they'll turn the ship around here but they're playing from behind at this point and it just takes a lot of time and resources to actually build out new fabs and get new process nodes running (which is why they're cutting the dividend here).",22-02-2023 14:47
qpvzy6,investing,"Post: AMD is well poised to take over the alternate universe

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/amd-shares-jump-after-company-wins-meta-partnership.html

Virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse. I daresay these are just the starting points to the entrance to a whole new alternate universe.

AMD has partnerships with Microsoft and Sony for gaming console chips and now has signed up Meta (Facebook) as a new customer. We all know what Facebook was planning when it changed name to Meta and AMD is going to benefit tremendously from this partnership.

It's gradually taking away market share from Intel and soon we will reach a point where Intel might not even be a competitor to AMD. While the need for CPUs is here to stay, most future tech would be based on GPUs, a sector where AMD has a strong footing.

Have a long position in AMD, bought at 115. Would buy more before it hits 200.

Edit: adding a section to explain why GPUs would support future AI and VR tech more than CPUs.

GPUs are better at performing mathematical and geometric calculations than CPUs. That's why they are crucial for AI/ML and VR.
This is also why GPUs are used intensively for crypto mining. 
CPUs are crucial for putting everything together and perform code and logic processing. That's why GPUs won't replace CPUs but as we move towards more complex requirements for altverse, we would need powerful CPUs but we would need much more advanced GPUs. For instance take high end pc games. High end games can run on a mid-end I5 CPU but need a high end GPU.

16sis76,investing,"Post: $AMD just messed up my strategy :P

Hey there everyone, 

Wondering what you guys would do in my place. I had some AMD stocks, which as you probably know, dropped along with most of the market last week. I had a stop loss set at $90, which was triggered when the stock dropped below that level for like 2 seconds. :P   


Now it's back above it and I'm wondering if I should just bite the bullet and buy them again, or if I should wait to see what happens next before jumping back in. 

&#x200B;

Thoughts welcome. 

Top Comments:
1. Why  did you have a stop loss?  Are you trading or investing?  What was your purchase price and what was your price target?
2. are we looking at the same stock? AMD hasn’t been $90 since May. If you meant a stop loss of $100, then I’d say it worked because we are a few dollars below that.
3. September statistically ends low, Oct-Dec typically end higher.  If you’re planning to hold long term, buying this week is likely a good opportunity.

I’m short AMD @$120 and planning to close this week in anticipation of a Q4 recovery.
4. Imagine how much of a genuine you would be had the stock continued dropping….

Don’t worry about it.
5. Assuming it's a taxable account you can deduct the loss to adjust your AGI (taxes) for the year. If you rebuy now it's considered a ""wash sale"" and you can't so consider investing in something else.",26-09-2023 09:18

AMD is poised to take about 2% of server share in each of Q3 and Q4 in contrast to Intel expectations of holding server shares in 2H21. This does not even consider the new Genoa server platform is more powerful. AMD just needs to continue what it is doing to at least 2024 with the transistor advantage it carries.

2. Margin for console chip is quite low. That's why NVIDIA didn't bother.

I decided to try trading on the stock market for the first time this week. I invested $30,000 in AMD and also took about $30,000 on margin (maximum allowed). I bought 10,000 AMD shares. The moment I bought them they started dropping and today they reached $5.42. It means I am down almost $5000. What should I do? Should I get out and accept the losses? Or do you think I should wait and hope it recovers back to $5.90? I am also considering getting rid of margin and selling about 5500 shares to cover it and then just wait until my part recovers. Any tips for a new trader?

Dude, that is some *serious* and I mean SERIOUS fucking risk right there.  Sweet mother of god.  I don't like giving flat out buy/sell advice but SELL THAT FUCKING SHIT ASAP and get the hell out of at least the 30k worth of margin in a single stock.   Sweet jesus, you like to live dangerously don't you.

FYI, I don't think AMD is a bad choice, I kind of like AMD.  I **DO** think buying 60k worth (30k on margin) is a wee-bit crazy.

Thoughts?  Anyone?  I'd love a second opinion over here.
3. Buy enough AMD to move the market.
4. Ok, I tend to be reservedly pro-trading- i.e., I don't think it's a bad idea if you really read up on what you are doing and play it low risk.

But this is not trading.  This is gambling.  Don't trade like this.  At all.  Ever.  0___0

Analyze stocks, develop a theory, pick a stop before you make the trade to automatically exit the trade if that point is hit because your theory is disproved, and then calculate the amount you're putting in so that if it drops to your stop you've only lost a small percentage of your account.

Either invest in indexes or pick up a book on risk management.  The only use you should have for margin is to allow you to take multiple trades with similar low risk at once.  You shouldn't be using it to pile on one trade.

10hyf98,investing,"Post: Valuing Semiconductor manufacturers and a look at INTC, AMD, TSM and MU

I would like to build a position in a semiconductor manufacturer as their valuations come under pressure in the downturn for this cycle. I intend to look at the data they release in the upcoming earnings reports. As I look at that information what do you think are the most critical components of it to determine the outlook for these companies? I'm currently looking at their PE, Forward PE, Price to Earnings Growth and Price to Free Cash Flow. Stocks on my list at the moment are INTC, AMD, TSM and MU. This is in part because I'd like to buy an even lot eventually so that I can hedge and potentially profit with options. 

As I see it right now INTC is a multiyear recovery story with a high dividend that may need to come down with all the capital outlay involved in their turnaround despite having plenty of free cash flow. While their PE looks cheap compared to some others their FPE looks about inline and analysts don't see much more room to the upside. I am wary.

AMD looks like it has some potential despite having a high current PE their FPE looks to be a little but mostly inline. Their Price to Earnings Growth and Free Cash Flow look less attractive but at the moment analysts are still calling for some reasonable upside to the stock.

TSM looks to be growing well according to the Price to Earnings Growth but the stock price has mostly priced that in and the Free Cashflow looks to be under pressure. Its 2.47% dividend is potentially under even more pressure than INTC according to the financials as it commits to expanding here in the states.

Lastly MU seems to be struggling the most with Cash Flow out of the four and potentially hitting a growth slowdown. 

Thoughts about the companies themselves and advice about trying to determine the value of these businesses going forward are much appreciated.

Top Comments:
1. Don’t forget ASML, all of the companies you mention rely on them
2. Just buy SMH etf.
3. Some of INTC MU and TSMC  growth is provided by the CHIPS Act in the US, which is partially subsidizing that.   

AMD doesn't make it's own chips to my knowledge, it designs them for the likes of TSM to make.  For that AMD might not be getting the same kind of CHIPSy tailwind as the others.

Last couple years with the chip shortage from the pandemic showed the US manufacturing was maybe at the mercy of foreign countries, so there was that decision to invest heavily in US chip manufacturing.   It might have swung the pendulum too far, where chips where quite profitable  when supplies were short, I expect all this new capacity to decrease the profitability on chips for at least a couple years as supply capacity might out pace demand.

Warren B. just dumped a load into TSM, and he has made money before, so there's that.  He can also change the price of stocks for as much as he dumps in, so on a short term basis, that might be a factor.  That Colorado river has been getting pretty low, which could be a factor with TSM as well.
4. Have you excluded AVGO (Broadcom) for any particular reason?  PE is in the 15/16 range.

What are your 5 growth stock picks for 2024? About 50% of my portfolio will be S&P500 for steadiness and diversification. But I like to add in some single stocks to give a little more growth. We can look back at this post in 1 year and see how our picks played out. My picks are MSFT, INTC, COST, TT, ODFL. And my wildcard would be COKE. I think tech is still going to reign supreme, but the Fed will be the main driver of market action depending on their rate decisions.

Top Comments:
1. So much tech in these comments.  Feels like the big names have been frontrunning for so long it's hard to fathom there is even more growth to squeeze out of them.  Not saying I disagree, but it's strange to me in about the span of 15 years we've seen the S&P basically consolidate into 8 tickers and 492 also-rans.  

I really like COST as well; I can't ever remember being in a Costco that wasn't busy.  I think we're all kicking ourselves for not doubling down on the winners at the start of 2023 - is it as simple as doing that this upcoming year?
2. I still believe that Google is underestimated in AI. Personally I would bet on GOOGL and MSFT. 

Or simply hold an index fund because the whole economy will benefit from increased productivity.
3. MSFT 

Reasoning:
- AI is going to be strongly adopted by enterprises in 2024 and beyond
- There is effectively no growth ceiling to AI
- The most valuable AI company in the world is OpenAI, and they will likely have GPT-5 next year - leaving competitors in their dust (no one is even competitive to GPT-4 right now)
- The only way to buy into it as a retail investor is to buy MSFT which owns 49% of OpenAI
- Microsoft monetizes via GPT-5 powered copilot subscriptions for Microsoft 365 for enterprise customers, and Azure AI services
4. I’m trying to stop buying individual stocks. It’s really fun, and I have some big wins, like COST and AMD, but then my losers tend to drag me slightly below the S&P. I think I’m best off being boring and sticking with ETFs.

This year I’m leaning into SOXX, XLK, QUAL, SUSL, and VOO.

It’s all tech heavy and SOXX is my AI play. I think that’s the trend that continues through 2024. I do want to get more COST exposure, though.

I've seen this happen way to many times so I played it safe putting in what I'm comfortable gambling but still sucks to see it go.

2. Now do Tesla
3. Holy shit intel has gross profit of 42 bil? Thats nuts... I don't think amy company has profits like that other than Apple
4. [deleted]
5. Intel has been struggling lately.  They have not been able to move beyond their current 10nm process, despite a lot of trying.  Their main market, PCs, has been stagnant or in decline.  They're trying, but they don't seem to be able to enter other markets.  A lot of the OEMs are now selling PCs with AMD processors, which did not happen when AMD had the best chip in the 00s.

That having been said, I am long Intel, and do not own AMD or NVIDIA stock.  I think AMD and NVIDIA are excellent companies, but they might be overpriced.  

I have a lot of confidence Intel are going to turn it around, just like they have every other time they've been behind.  They did it when DEC had the Alpha, and AMD had the first x64 chip.  I just don't think it's going to be quick or soon, and a lot of institutional investors likely don't want to wait a year or two to see how things shake out.  (""Being early is the same as being wrong"")  It will be interesting to see what happens in 2021 when they should have their new fab setup.

There is also a lot of discussion about the problems with letting TSMC create most of the world's chips.  AMD and NVidia are both dependent on TSMC for fabbing.  This gives them some flexibility in terms of not have a massive capital asset on their books, but at the same time, gives them other problems.  For starters TSMC is in Taiwan, which the Chinese have been claiming as theirs.  There was also the curious way NVidia was turning away customers when all the miners were buying everything they could get their hands on.  TSMC has recently announced they'll be building a fab in Arizona, but I still think Intel is going to have an advantage when it comes to concerns about national security.  Intel may also be capable of getting some help paying for their next fab from the US government for this reason.

I do not think Intel will be going away any time soon, but I do think their stock isn't as sexy as AMD or NVida.  I think the biggest possible risk with owning Intel is that it's likely to move sideways for quite a while.  That having been said, they seem to be trading far below the multiples for the industry sector, and their competitors.",08-07-2020 14:04
xl78k7,investing,"Post: Buying the dip: AMD or INTC

I am planning to buy either AMD or Intel stock sometime during this year's (or next year's) market crash, and was wondering which stock people thought would see a higher rate of return. 

As much as I prefer AMD's products compared to Intel, and is now at a favorable price and 1 year low ($70ish...will probably keep dipping), Intel stock is near a 5 year low, and has suffered unfortunate news stories that probably deflated its stock and I believe is far oversold.

Please give me your opinion and reasoning.

Top Comments:
1. AMD is like TSLA, the fanboys hype it up past its real value.

Buy AMD.
2. Intel has no means to produce competitive products in the mid term, they failed their latest manufacturing process and are basically squeezing out the last few drops out of their old architecture. They also invest heavily in US and European factories, which might be good in the long run but will certainly cost a lot of money in the short term.

AMD meanwhile is eating Intel's market shares on the consumer and data center sectors, at accelerating paces. With the aquisition of xilinix they also expand into the industrial/robotics sector. Their CPU's (and hopefully next Gen GPUs) are just the best bang for the buck, more processing power with better power efficiancy. The only bear case, beside broader market condition, is their dependency on TSMC, if China decides to say f\*ck it, let's go for Taiwan, it would be instant knockout for AMD (although you better worry about collecting bottlecaps instead of stock prices then).

Imo trying to catch Intel is trying to catch the falling knife.
3. I don’t know how you can have an opinion here without having an opinion on how important you think fabs are in the value chain.  What if apple just pays tmsc more than AMD and squeezes them out?  Can Intel actually catch up?  I guess at least intc is cheap
4. I'm not touching any semiconductors ... in fact I have been shorting them (SOXS) for the past 6 months and will continue to do so.  Semiconductors are highly cyclical and we are still heading into a deep hole.  Estimates are a 25% drop in demand in 2023, the worst since the year 2000.  In 2023 after another 50% drop, I will go shopping based on who looks better at that time.
5. I'd pick AMD. They are still gaining market share at the cost of Intel losing some. With the new generation of CPUs to be released I believe this trend will continue. AMD in the graphic department us somewhat lackluster but there might be light at the end of the tunnel with their new release in November. They likely won't beat Nvidia in performance but they have a good chance at releasing products with much better value now that the pricing of Nvidia is out of proportion. Of course that is pure speculation but should AMD be succesful in the graphic department then they will be accelerating their revenue in both CPU and GPU department.",22-09-2022 17:12

O is all over the place and has had some deep losses, but it has also recovered significantly already.  AMD is but one company in a hot field, so why not diversify into tech or even an ETF that centers around AI?  The point is to hedge bets that you might not pick the ""one.""  Buy the haystack rather than searching for the needle.
2. YouTube gets a bad rep many times due to so many finance influencers. But there are a handful of very good channels that take a deep dive into financials of individual stocks & comparing performance of ETF's, REIT,s BDC's & other dividend paying stocks.

Buying a couple of good stocks in the growth-like AMD-and dividend aristocrat-like O-categories you really can't go wrong. But like the other comment mentions it's a great idea at your age to educate yourself. Luckily today there are so many free resources to learn you can set yourself up to do really well. Congrats on being so conscientious of your financial future & taking control at such a young age. 

Here are some great YouTube channels:

3. I'm not sure we'll see any interest rate cuts except if a recession occurs which doesn't seem likely at the moment.  Powell has said that the current rate is restrictive but I don't see any evidence that it's restricting the economy.  I wouldn't but O just on the thesis that interest rates will cause it to appreciate.
4. The investment strategy that makes the most sense to me is warren buffet strategy.  He doesn't do short trades.  Charle Munger said he doesn't short anymore in his interviews latter on life.  All they do is to pick what they think is the best 20 or so companies in the world and put money there long term.  You don't want to have too many because you won't have time to keep track of all of them.  Warren Buffet is also very patient and tend to go all on a stock he wants in at the right moment.  

Personally, I stick to a philosophy that is similar to warren buffet.  I don't have time to speculate and do short term trades.  Most people with 8-5 jobs only have time to long stocks and you will go crazy if you have to keep track of things at each and every moment.  I don't like O because it is hardly one of the top companies.  AMD is extremely solid, but the current valuation is highly questionable.  You should be more patient.  If you need to park your money, there are many safe ways to do so with decent returns.",08-02-2024 20:32

1. Stock is +445% in the last year. Is -5.5% in the last month and all the sudden, bunch of posts on OMG, whaddo I do. If you are surprised when something that is up +445% in a year has a moderate pullback (and when you look at the 1mo period, it's only a bit over 5%), then - well, you shouldn't be, if we're being honest.

If you bought it a couple of bucks higher, then did you have a strong thesis on why you bought it or were you just chasing hype? If the former, do you believe that the story has changed? If not, why aren't you adding more? If you are chasing hype, then this is an example of what can happen when you chase hype.

Still, the thing is down a bit over 5% in a month and is still up 30% over the last three. 
2. Ignoring them, like most of my portfolio.  
Watching your investments too closely leads to duplicating the emotional reactions of too many other investors, meaning ""following the pack"", which is a bad way to invest.  
I do watch some stocks some times, when I think I have extra insight or a decision is very important.

1. Nvidia and AMD are great companies to invest in, but crypto is a dumb reason to invest in them.
2. Crypto is moving away from proof of work to proof of stake, GPUs will soon be irrelevant.
3. 

A **decade** ago you could mine Bitcoin with GPUs. Those days are long gone, though. 

You can still mine Ethereum with GPUs right now, but that is also supposed to end *this year*. 

Basically, there will be no connection to GPUs and any major cryptocurrency. 

In fact, because of Ethereum dropping GPU support soon, it's possible eBay will be *flooded* with old video cards, crashing their price, and driving down the price of new video cards, as well. NVidia stock might drop a bit. Or, because more gamers will have better access to GPUs, NVidia stock might go up a bit.
4. Nvidia and AMD are more than just that. The main reason I believe to invest in these companies is the Data Center and AI opportunity available. With that being said, I am aware of the possible PC GPU glut which is reflected by the YTD decline.
5. Nvidia is surely my choice, but due to its data center business. GPU for mining and gaming is classified as a gaming segment. Buying Nvidia due to its game business is also good. But crypto, no.",30-07-2022 06:35

1. I feel like Intel is a good example of falling asleep at the wheel. And a demonstration of a quote from NVidias CEO, something like, if you're not innovating, you're falling behind.

I do think they have started to turn around, but it's late, and so now we have a lagging valuation, relative to what Intel is actually doing at present. Partly due to the nature of the industry. Intel could release of best in class CPU's, GPU's and other ASICs tonight, and it'll still take a year to generate genuine valuation change (besides pricing in positive speculation).
2. Their GAAP earnings are negative. Their BS earnings are positive. Stop using their made-up earnings number in the title and post.

From your own source:

Second-quarter GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $(0.11); non-GAAP EPS was $0.29.
3. Man.  When will it take for people to finally realize Intel is NOT a play for any growth of capital for the next 2-3 years AT LEAST.  

You have to understand the semi industry and know different companies engineering caliber and culture.  Intel is bottom at both.  Patty G is a positive choice for a CEO who could turn the ship around, but he has a long way to go to prove if he can turn it.

These last results were horrible.  Go listen to the earnings call.  Even the analysts asking questions had the tone of like ""how could you be THIS bad??""

Amd: Strike Around 240, expiring June 2025
Intel: Strike Around 55, expiring January 2026

I feel with Intel they have a lot of potential because they are starting to compete a little bit better with their new meteorlake chips, and by getting into the AI space. Intel is also a lot more cheaper and I can get a decent price for a further contract. This would give me some more time to hope for them to come up with something good. AMD is a lot more expensive for a contract expiring sooner. This doesn't give me much time and I don't know if they really are cooking up anything different from what they're already doing. AMD is a lot more reliable though.

1. I'm very long on AMD and have been in there since the $1.8. While I obviously enjoy the stock it is super unrealistic in my mind to reach 240 by June 2025. In this case I would say Intel considering they went up to the 48s and are a much bigger company and they are going to get their new fab strategy under control.
2. By both of the expiry dates we should know if we’ve had a soft landing, a hard landing or no landing. I’d go with AMD on this one. In my head there’s room for the stock to ease somewhat and then start to go up again long term. At the end of the day it’s still a gamble, but I’d give you 60/40 for AMD/Intel. Good luck.

4. I see a lot of mentions of AMD, and a bunch of Nvidia, but almost nothing about ARM. Sure, AMD is competitive with Intel for x86 and Nvidia is getting a lot of attention for GPU-powered machine learning, but don't sleep on ARM. We're probably on the precipice of a huge shift to ARM in the datacentre that's being driven by public cloud providers.

Consider AWS which have been rolling out ARM ""Graviton2"" virtual machines all year:

1. Compared to their x86 counterparts, the Graviton2 are faster for many workloads, are more thermally efficient, and cost less for both Amazon _and_ their customers. AWS instances are billed by the second and usually autoscaled, meaning customers will launch and destroy dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of VMs every day. Servers are not hand-configured one at a time and named after Star Wars characters -- you can't launch a thousand servers a day that way -- instead they're built through automation. This isn't just for speed, it's for repeatability so that when you boot up a server, you don't have to second-guess that it's going to be precisely configured already. So, if you already have the automation in place, and only needed to adjust one variable to start launching ARM machines instead of x86 for less money and more performance, why wouldn't you?

2. ""That's not fair -- the software all has to be re-compiled or even rewritten to work on ARM!"" That's true! I'll get to that in a moment. Here's a type of server you can use right now without rewriting _any_ software: managed database instances. One of the hardest things to do well in a tech org is to run ""stateful"" workloads like databases, which is why all the major cloud providers offer fully-managed database services of many flavours of SQL, caching, and NoSQL databases. Click a few buttons and get MySQL, with patching, backups, and auto-failover managed by the cloud provider. Postgres already runs on ARM, and the data stored by Postgres doesn't care whether the CPU architecture that stored it was ARM or x86 or PowerPC. Replace your managed database instances powered by x86 with the ARM version and start getting that better (and cheaper) performance without having to rewrite anything, _and_ keep all your data. No migration, just shut it down, and turn it back on again with new CPUs. The public cloud providers are going to make a killing on this and they know it.

3. Ok, so what _about_ the apps the tech org writes to power the business? The things that have to be recompiled and maybe even heavily rewritten? Pipelines rebuilt? And the servers underneath them, won't the management software also need to support ARM? Yeah, that's going to take some time and effort, but maybe less than you think. Workload management is becoming increasingly commodified. Orgs that have existing IT assets and tooling will have to make investments in converting their pipeline if they think it's worthwhile (and it may not be in the short term). New startups or new working groups within existing organizations though have no such baggage. They probably won't even run their own servers. Fully-managed containerization platforms or partially-managed platforms powered by something like Kubernetes (think GKE, EKS, AKS) mean that the cloud provider deals with running the servers, and you just ship them the workload. Are you in a golang shop? Target ARM and push.

A tailwind to all this is Apple's shift to ARM, and while it may not have an outsized effect on the datacentre, it doesn't hurt.

Long story short: AMD and Nvidia will make things interesting for Intel in the coming years, but if you want to know where the industry is going, look to ARM.

EDIT: Lot of comments pointing out Nvidia's ownership of ARM. Yep, I get it, this is an investing sub and readers are going to be looking at this at a business perspective. ARM is a major _architectural_ change in technology though, which is typically a hard sell, but is being made not only possible but desirable due to the commodification of the datacentre. If you want to buy the winner then buy the winner, but no one is asking why ARM is all of a sudden positioned to succeed in the datacentre now when the chips have been around for decades.

gtldnq,investing,"Post: Why shouldn’t I invest in AMD?

I just don’t understand why. I hold in NVDA but had not looked at INTC or AMD until a few weeks ago. I knew AMD has beat Intel in the consumer market with their CPU’s, especially considering Intel’s failure with the 10nm stuff. However, I have seen lots of advice not to invest in AMD from the same people investing in NVDA. Why not?

Top Comments:
1. I remember when AMD was at $2 back in 2016. All the talk in r/wsb, amazing that’s a $54 stock now. Can be explained by this:

INTC - PE 12x - 2% dividend

AMD - PE 125x - 0% dividend

Not sure of the upside on AMD to be honest. Even assuming that they grow 20% per year, it is going to take 10+ years for them to match INTC’s PE. I understand that PE is not everything, but I am not sure that will be a $600 Bn stock, 3 times INTC.

NVDA has cornered the GPU/AI market. INTC just need a great chipset to turn the tide on AMD.
2. Basically they are currently over-valued. They have some things coming up (notablely next gen console integration), but this is already priced in due to the overvaluation. The time to get in was March, getting it now is just a way to piss away money.
3. Avoid jumping on hype trains
4. AMD is solid. $50 area is a great entry point IMO. They are rapidly taking market share from Intel and growing revenues at like 20%. 

Gotta be careful what advice you take. Lots of people pander 100% ETF’s and rag on people owning some individuals.

For those wondering why there was a broad market sell off this afternoon, the Federal Reserve released the minutes of the December 14-15 FOMC meeting at 2:00pm ET.

The transcript for the minutes can be found here -  [The Fed - Monetary Policy: (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20211215.htm)

If you read the minutes, there are discussions about Fed's balance sheet reduction and hints that interest rates may be raised sooner than initially believed by the market.

Excerpt from minutes "" Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate. Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures. ""

Is that a decent strategy or should I should just hold until something drastic changes in the core business. When does one decides it's time to sell in a case like this?

Top Comments:
1. I wish I had held onto my 700 shares, but I slowly sold them off starting at $17 and ending at around $45. I made a substantial profit, but it could have been a ludicrous. 

Part of me obviously regrets it, but another part of me did that because I felt it was getting overvalued. LOVE the company, really believe in the leadership, but the current price is too forward thinking for my blood.
2. Honestly, I just started investing so don't take my word for it but I'd personally hold on to it. I've been following AMD for years and they've been releasing bangers of processors and graphics cards and they are on the road to a $100 billion market cap I believe. Plus their main competitor, Intel, won't be catching up to them anytime soon since they won't manufacture 7nm chips until 2022.

4. If you held until something drastic happened, odds are very likely it would affect the price long before you got wind of it. You can decide for yourself if AMD is a bubble, but people have been saying this about the stock for years now.

pa0kix,investing,"Post: As I'm writing this NVDA has overtaken TSM as the world's most valuable semiconductor company

NVDA market cap:  $535,91B

TSM market cap:  $517,93B

ASML market cap: $333,46B

INTC market cap: $213,92B

I fully realize that the term ""semiconductor"" is no more perfectly accurate for NVDA as it has been expanding heavily on the software side, yet that software is based on them selling chips so I still think its the correct category of industries for NVDA and a very interesting observation of what the market thinks the future of these companies holds.

3. I'm not sure how much you can really draw from this. NVDA doesn't manufacture anything, and its margins are entirely dependent on favorable pricing from a rapidly consolidating industry which, at the leading edge, basically consists of TSM, INTC, and Samsung. TSM, on the other hand, is manufacturing physical goods using specialized processes that require billions of dollars of investment to advance and maintain, and they can sell their capacity to NVDA just as readily as they can AAPL, AMD, QCOM, etc.
4. I know how Intel is lagging behind its competitors, etc, etc. But their revenue is 7 times that of Nvidia and they are still growing. Are people expecting Nvidia to make double of Intels revenue? They can make a series of amazing products but that's not going to happen anytime soon.

There's a new phase ahead in the semiconductor sector that will have major implications for the market dynamics in the semiconductor sector: the transition to next generation techniques involved in >5nm nodes. Lets discuss the implications and our strategies!

What companies do you think will benefit from the adoption of next-gen techniques in the decade to come, and why? I'll provide my theories in the comments.

1. Intel's stock price hasn't moved in 22 years
2. I think Intel is becoming a catalyst in the sector's advance because their intended expansion into the foundry business already is driving investments by TSMC and others in order to position themselves for competing with some of their advanced capabilities and this trend will only gain momentum going forward. I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.

I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it.
3. Currently working in Semiconductor, as far as I can tell you the nm is just not that much of a game changer compare to ""vertical stacking"" - just simple as stack 2, 3 or more layers of die on a single unit. Pretty much the idea is out there but no one can do it on commercial scale, whoever master this technique will go really, really far.
4. The semiconductor stock to buy was AOSL. Up 50% in two months.
5. $TSM seems like they will reign supreme. In leading nodes it's winner take all. Samsung might be the first to GAAFET, but it doesn't seem their node is actually better than FINFET by TSMC anyway.

Over the coming years, TSMC will increase the capacity for leading nodes to the point that they can supply $AMD with enough wafers. When that happens, there is a lot you can do with the increased supply of leading nodes, like a console mid-generation refresh, Steam Deck 2, etc. things that so far are not announced

But maybe $ASML is not able to deliver all of the machines everyone needs",22-03-2022 20:46
sl5fyj,investing,"Post: Many of the largest most successful technology companies in the 1980s and 1990s died in the tech crash of 2000-2003 and never really recovered

Now that the FANG stocks have dropped everyone is looking to buy on the dip.  These FANG stocks are very large and have a history of success.  But if history is a guide many of them may underperform for decades going forward.

Remember INTEL, IBM, and CSCO?  They were not the high-flying no-earnings [dot.com](https://dot.com) companies everyone remembers crashing in the 2000-2003 period.  Instead, they were hugely successful companies that boomed in the 1980s and 1990s.  Lots of revenue and profits.

But they crashed in the early 2000s and never really came back as strong. **THEY ARE STILL AROUND** but have moved into tier two.  An investment in these companies in 2000 will still give you a return significantly below a total stock market fund.

Will Facebook, PayPal, Amazon, and Microsoft going forward follow the lead of CSCO, IBM, and Intel?

2. Never came back strong? Are we looking at the same MSFT here? There also quite a difference between buying CSCO and Intel at 200 PE then and buying FB or Google at under 30 today.
3. MSFT was there in 2000. Was tier one then, is tier one now. You need to spend some time to really understand what each of these companies do. Something like netflix can be replaced, something like google or msft, would take more than a decade to replace.
4. AMD returned 525% since 2000 vs SPY returning 390%. OP, are you using actual data or making some terribly inaccurate statements?
5. AMD is not really the best example. It's stock peaks are correlated to its fundamentals with its architectures. In 1999/2000 AMD had Athlon, a legit competitor to Intel. In 2004/2005 AMD had Athlon 64/x2, which was the champ, and took significant server market share (with Opteron). Starting in 2006, Intel started kicking AMD's behind again with the Core series (Core2, tic/tok, Core series). AMD lost market share, then in 2011 launched a underwhelming architecture (Bulldozer), which kept it dragged down until around 2017, which saw the start of the Zen architecture. Zen has been an absolute powerhouse for AMD and they've gained market share in every segment (servers, laptop, desktop). Zen still looks great moving forward, but Intel is just now becoming more competitive.",05-02-2022 12:03

4. Bought in at $1.89 a share. Confident that it's going up even more over the next few years. 
5. Revenue increased by 18% YoY and is guided to increase 12% in Q2 2017 YoY.  Gross margin expanded 2% and OCF was terrible.  Computing and graphics was up 29% YoY on the back of several huge product launches but still had a negative contribution to earnings.  ASP in the segment was up on CPUs and GPUs but obviously so were expenses. Gross margin is projected to be back down to 33% in Q2.

CFO commentary put FY 2017 having a 'low double digit' increase in revenue margins expected to 'improve'.

So AMD manages to continue limping along and the company didn't make much money simply by dramatically undercutting Intel.

Pretty much as expected but I'm sure the fan boys will start shouting about how it'll be Naples that will change things.  Overall AMD is going to be in a tough spot until it can actually start selling processors at higher price points period.",01-05-2017 20:34

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

3. Buy the rumor sell the news.
4. Full disclosure: Long 3/3 $15 puts as of this morning.

First off the market overall is down, probably on some profit taking.

NDA was lifted today and official reviews came out.  The processor is a strong performer but isn't shattering all of Intel's high end processors like some people anticipated.  Additionally there's been issues using higher clocked RAM on their new chipsets.

In general the stock ran up on hype and now people are probably starting to take a sober look at things and trying to tease out how much money the company isn't actually going to make.

I've pointed this out before but keep in mind AMD ITSELF issued a bunch of stock, convertible debt and warrants at around $8/share and they have insider knowledge of expected yields and product margins.  Ryzen might be a great product, that doesn't mean AMD is going to make a boatload of money off of it, especially if they're focused on undercutting Intel to gain back market share.

68trrx,investing,"Post: AMD - Lesson in Valuation

Lets ignore the news and momentum moves and try to understand something about companies and valuations. 

AMD is a money losing business most banked on dying a couple of years ago. For high risk companies like this it is good to think in terms of probabilities. 

If the companies dies it has little debt and probably enough IP to be worth 3-4 billion. If the company recovers, what would it look like? 

Looking at its major competitor, NVDA, Nvidia has around USD7 billion in revenues and about a 27% EBITDA margin, and is trading around 26x EBITDA. 

If we want to look at what AMD may look like on a recovered basis, lets say revenue grows 50% from USD4.3 bn to USD6.4 billion at some point and lets say EBITDA margins recovers to 25% and it trades at 20x EBITDA, it would imply a market cap of around USD32 billion. 

Looking at recent pricing action, the shares were trading around 14.5~ which implied around a 14 billion market cap in March, which meant investors were pricing a 40-45% chance of recovery. The recent pricing action suggest investors are losing some faith, with that implied probability now falling to 30%. 

http://imgur.com/a/Zez2Q

As for what AMD should be valued at, plug in your own probabilities and determine your own valuation. I have no special insights greater than the market.

All I'm seeing is they burned through alot of cash and the gross margins are not widening enough? Is there something I am missing?

2. And the crowd goes...mild.

It's insane how high expectations were  that even a blowout quarter did nothing to the share price.
3. Literally on pace to make $400,000,000,000 in one year. 

Unreal.
4. In next 2-3 years AWS annual revenue will double, going beyond 100 billion. They are growing at 32% and margins are really good. That would make AWS market cap close to 1.5 trillion. So, you do the math after that ...

Amazon really needs to focus AWS and other high margin, paradigm shifting businesses.

oti40u,investing,"Post: Bear Theory on AMD valuation

EDIT - added more sources

Here's my bear theory on AMD:

AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage.

Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance benchmarks are all that matters.

AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance versus AMD chips.

[https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)

I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Therefore AMD is at **SIGNIFICANT RISK** to geopolitics.

They look good now but those sales could be demolished in a few months.

Here is a more technical paper on transistor gate lengths being the wrong measurement.[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714)

Here's an article on risks of TSMC contracts which I've seen no change in this sentiment.[https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-defense-department-looks-bolster-domestic-chip-manufacture-with-new-program-2020-12-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-defense-department-looks-bolster-domestic-chip-manufacture-with-new-program-2020-12-18/)

US DOD already has labeled Qualcomm as its RAMP phase 1 [https://breakingdefense.com/2021/06/dod-seeks-2-3b-to-bolster-chip-making/](https://breakingdefense.com/2021/06/dod-seeks-2-3b-to-bolster-chip-making/)

and guess who already cut-off AMD from that access:

2. >Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC

LOL no. no they wont.
3. a) TSMC will likely have a US-based foundry up and running by 2023-2024

b) INTC has time and over again gamed benchmarks to make themselves look better, if you look at independent sources, INTC in some cases has the lead, not always, but at what cost? Their silicon is running red-hot given that it is being cranked to the max with power. This matters and it matters a lot in the data-center space where performance isn't the only metric but power efficiency plays a role too

c) AMD is fabless, this is a fantastic advantage, what makes you think that it's hard for AMD to comission Samsung or any other foundry for that matter to manufacture its chips?
4. How much did you lose your on puts today?
5. >I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probablyterminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primarysupply.

I think there is ZERO chance of this happening can you cite any sources to back up this wild far out , almost conspiracy style prediction?

Also if it did, it would completely cripple our own economy; like you couldn't buy electronics.

EDIT  
I realize you said ""its own use"", still very unlikely as it would put huge strains on their supply chains .",28-07-2021 20:20
9ur0g6,investing,"Post: Warren Buffett Value Investing Cheat Sheet - A handy check-list I compiled

Below is a handy check-list for valuing investing the old-school Warren Buffett way. I thought you might find it useful.

All the stats are derived from Buffett's advice over the years through shareholder letters and other sources. In my opinion, it is nearly impossible for a company to tick all of these boxes in the current market, but they are useful guidelines.

Anything else you guys would add to the list? What other metrics / checks do you use?

* Debt/Equity < 0.5
* Current Ratio > 1.5 && < 2.5
* Price/Book < 1.5
* ROE > 8% consistent/increasing over last 10 yrs
* ROA > 6%
* Stable Book Value growth
* Stable EPS growth
* Stable Dividend growth
* Moat
* Interest coverage ratio (Income from operations/Interest expense) > 5X operating income
* Inventory turnover ratio (Cost of Revenue/Inventory) > 4
* Free-cash-flow-to-revenue ({Operating cash flow + property, plant & equipment} / Revenue) > 5%
* P/E Ratio < 15
* S&P rating > BB
* Reasonable Margin of safety (DCF intrinsic value/current price)

&#x200B;

I compiled many of the above criteria into strategies. You can find these rules-based investment strategies at **Aikido Finance**

2. I think you nailed it.

One thing that I think is worth nothing is something Charlie Munger said, and it is one of Buffett's principles.

Don't buy a company because they meet all of the qualifying metrics. Find a company you love, trust and believe in. Then wait for that company to dip and meet those metrics.

He compared it to fishing. Wait for the big fish that you set out to go and catch. Don't settle for one that is almost as big.
3. > In my opinion, it is nearly impossible for a company to tick all of these boxes in the current market, but they are useful guidelines.

That's pretty much the reason why Berkshire announced buybacks. Couldn't find anywhere to put their cash.

1c2d32g,investing,"Post: What stocks/ETFs are down right now that you’d invest in?

I’m looking for stocks to hold long term that are currently down. If your HYSA and your retirement accounts are taken care of and doing well. What stocks would you buy with a brokerage account that has $2,500 in it?

I’m considering Tesla, Boeing, and Tilray

Edit: The above stocks are examples of the types of stocks I’m interested in. I may not choose any of them. The take away is that they are low and have the potential to jump back.

After reading some of the initial comments I agree SPY, VOO, Etc are great long term holdings. I’m heavily invested in S&P 500 ETFs with my retirement funds. This account would be for promising stocks that are currently down, have long term potential, but will ultimately have more risk.

Top Comments:
1. Boeing is going to be a rollercoaster for a long time. They've got a mess they need to figure out.
2. If it was me $200 a week into VOO or VT over tbe next year
3. VTI QQQM SCHD for the next 20 years
4. For long term hold, stick to ETFs.  Less risky.  

I wouldn't buy any of the 3 you mentioned with the intention of long term holding.  Too risky.

I’d like to hear what all the investors out there would do with this small amount to make it grow as efficiently as possible. My mind goes to stocks but with how the market is right now, maybe that’s not best option?

Long term i would think to have it grow into an amount enough for a down payment on a property and then rent the property out for an income. But how would you get it to enough?

Another idea I have is maybe to invest it into some sort entrepreneurial endeavour? Either yourself or someone else?

Top Comments:
1. “How the market is right now”

The market dropped for 6 months and has now rebounded for 2. It will always rise and fall, but you have to be invested to benefit from the long term uphill climb. 

Index funds (mostly) and selected high quality company stock. First ensure that you have an adequate cash emergency fund.
2. Personally, VOO or VTI and forget about it until I'm ready to retire.
3. Buy SPY shares. Wait.

My question is...when should one expect to see the share price affected by this move? I'm thinking of putting more money into AMD stock, but I want to make sure I do it after the share prices drop from this move.

Top Comments:
1. The stock will drop at 12:42PM EST on 10/2/2016.  That will be the bottom.  Dump all your money into AMD at that moment.

On second thought, I recommend strictly mutual funds for you.
2. Probably a stupid question, but before this, there were 795 Million shares of AMD stock outstanding.  Given that AMD is offering 600 more, shouldn't that (roughly, with a small bonus for improved future  company outlook) mean that shares are worth ~60% less now, given the company has the same valuation, but the number of shares has gone up.

Why hasn't AMD's stock fallen more - what am I missing?
3. Well, it's public knowledge, so it's not surprising to see the market react.
4. Down premarket although was down worse after hours last night. Will probably open down.

68syit,investing,"Post: AMD a good buy now?

I've been holding off on buying AMD since I didn't really have the money and I always thought it was at a high point. Now though I do have some cash to invest and with it having just dropped by a lot I'm wondering if now is a good time to get in on it?

Top Comments:
1. Depends. The reason it's dropping so much is that a lot of people think it's time to sell. The reason it still has value is that a lot of us think $AMD long is a good play. I'm buying more in about 30 minutes, so you know where I stand. Feel free to gather more info from one of the dozens of threads littering /r/stockmarket , /r/investing , /r/wallstreet , /r/wallstreetbets or wherever else they are probably at. Just don;t go to /r/AMD
2. AMD is not a good bet right now. It was only riding momentum because people wanted it to desperately succeed and break intel and nvidia monopolies in cpu and gpu respectively. Ryzen is good but not good enough. Vega rumours are not looking good. Naples is a long shot at entering Server side chips which have more ramp up costs. Their SoC business is been making them money but it can die at any point Microsoft or Sony decide to get into their own hardware. 
3. The question is, to buy today or wait for tomorrow? 
4. Hello, 

*take what I write with a grain of salt if You may.* 

Long term, Even if say AMD market shares increases by a marginal rate, we're going to see a steady Increase In share value. I'm not a pundit in any means nor do I claim I've had ups and down. I am not also going with my gut feeling here. but from what I can see and based on AMD Marketing  strategies (if done right), AMD can actually reach estimated sales rendering profits. Also I don't own AMD products yet at least not until this coming quarter (Q2).  Also don't forget MS and Sony but that's just an understatement. I want to see Server based products! MORE THREADS means advances in tech!

AMD chips will Sell no doubt. Aside from the Commercial level of sales (almost solely owned by Intel with Nvidia flexing in) Amd Enthusiasts offerings are slim on consumer side. They will have opportunities as they build their relationship on the software support side. That is a good thing! Remember that!

*slight rant* I don't like to watch Youtubers reviewing products for shear reason of bias and Profound relationships with sponsors or distributors. its not a practice I adhere by but not disregarded.  But the truth is that people actually like watching these youtubers and grab on to their opinions as facts. * Honestly it really is Team RED against Teams Blue/Green. /Rant

Fact of the mater is We're in a very Tech/Hardware oriented era and Its amazing for investors. Cloud will be a big win for years to come along with VR (and its integrations of data base). You'll see keynotes from all chip developers state these in the upcoming months. Where AMD stands right now are with solid platform. They just need partners whom are willing to provide on time. 

If you are looking for big bucks in a short period of time. You've missed that boat. We're looking till 2020 for good returns. I'll be glad to invest. I invest in Tech and My favorite Underdog is AMD. I won't be upset with the tech From AMD, just their Marketing team.  

as for my gut, It always craves this excitement.  

Last word! Invest with MONEY YOU Can SPARE with the idea of Want and not NEED! If you NEED the Money, you shouldn't invest vs If you Want Money, this is a good platform to learn. 

AMD is a good buy with the considerations of bounce back Phase. (bounce back generally in my words means short silence of products to release until refined with over estimated results). 
5. Ask yourself again this question. The company is in trouble. There is nothing here for you to buy. ",02-05-2017 12:59

Payments processing, fintech with a lot more room to grow as LatAm modernizes. MercadoLibre earnings on Wednesday should show whether Covid has driven mass adoption of e-commerce and digital payments in Latin America, my bet is it has. I pick STNE as the more underrated, profitable, and reasonably valued LatAm play.
5. NVDA

Partnering with Microsoft, Nvidia has just locked in a permanent market by bringing CUDA to WSL2. For those that don't know, this means you can run Linux on Windows (including in Docker containers, if you wish) and still have full GPU access for machine learning purposes...but only with NVDA cards.",03-08-2020 08:39
1mkj8c,investing,"Post: Long AMD

Just bought 3000 shares worth. 

I have my reasons that go well beyond the new consoles, but I am curious to see what others think.

I rent a bunch of servers monthly, and I am really excited for them to start getting into this market. Intel has ruled servers/cloud computing for too long. Cloud computing isn't very hot thanks to the NSAdrama.

They are finally jumping in to tablets, and their graphical prowess make them perfect for entry level laptops (Which is a market that I can't see will go anywhere.)

With the new consoles, there will be a couple year lull on gaming pc sales. (Where Intel normally shines.) I believe that a couple year lull will be exactly what AMD will need to compete again in the market as more and more game makers will be gearing for performance gains on AMD chips.

With this economy being where it is, businesses will look for low cost solutions. 



Top Comments:
1. Looks like r/investing disagrees with you, so AMD will probably go up.
2. negative margins, debt heavy, EPS going from -$1.14 to $0.14

There just seem to be way better chip plays than AMD
3. I think you overestimate fear of the nsa when it comes to cloud computing. I'm fairly certain whoever is spending a crap-ton of money for cloud computing is trying to get the most efficient solution, not optimizing for tin-foil hat.
4. People like to harp on AMD but I for one hope they never die. They are the only competition to Intel and Intel is ridiculously and idiotically overpriced for the slight improvement in performance it gives over AMD chips. SLIGHT. You can throw numbers and charts at me all day but tell me you give a shit about it loading something 2 seconds faster than an AMD part that costs +50% less. Obviously Sony and Microsoft don't and I hope AMD continues it's hard struggle to success.
5. AMD was in the server market with Opteron a long time ago.  AMD can't really compete in this market because there are no companies that want to create a secondary set of designs for AMD parts.  ARM stands a better chance here than AMD does (although I think the possibility of ARM being widely used in datacenters is very overstated).

rzs88t,investing,"Post: Largest position for 2022?

Warren Buffet says diversification is protection from ignorance, and the best way to have market leading returns is to over allocate your portfolio if you’re confident in your selections. 

What’s your largest position for 2022? What percentage of your portfolio is it? What makes you confident? 

For me right now I’m big OXY and OXY/WS for 2022 with 300 and 429 shares respectively, about 16.5k. This is ~18% of my portfolio. I’m a fan of the company because they’re paying down billions in debt each year, and having worked for a highly leveraged company in the past I know how fabulous that can make earnings going forward. Each quarter they get 10’s of millions more profit for future quarters due to less debt repayment. They also have over 10 billion in FCF this year if oil stays at its current heights and lots of tangible assets if inflation gets out of control. Lastly, I like that the dividend is small - when it increases in the future it’ll be a stock price catalyst, and it’ll help keep my taxes lower in the meantime.

Warren Buffet also thinks we’re all ignorant, so he’s talking about us.

In all seriousness though, props for a more original pick. Energy has too many complicated drivers right now for me to really feel competent in that space.
3. I’m tilting more to financials, energy and consumer staples
4. I guess my largest positions are VTI and SCHX. I keep trying to pick individual stocks, having a few successes, but more frustration.

3. I've now seen a few Model 3s in the wild (Texas), and got a chance to look one over in the parking lot at work this morning. Seems like a very nice car, if a bit funny looking...but very few cars are completely appealing to me these days. I'd love to drive one to see how it feels.
4. I have a Model 3 and love the car.  A few disclosures -- I'm not a ""car guy"", so I've never been someone who is concerned with feeling the power of the car while driving, and I also own no Tesla stock (though honestly after driving my Model 3 for about a month I'm tempted to do some more research and buy a bunch).  Once they are able to up their production, I have no idea how this car doesn't just completely take over the market, especially when the $35k version is ready.  I live in Los Angeles and every 5th car on the road is a Tesla.  I know this is the investing subreddit, but since people are talking about the car in this thread I figured I'd throw a few facts out there after having driven it for a month:

(1) If you're in the market for a luxury mid-size sedan (caliber of BMW 5 series, Mercedes E Class, Audi A5, etc), you can get a Model 3 in about a month.  When I ordered mine they estimated the wait to be 2-4 months, but I had mine in 3 weeks (and I got some additional options/upgrades) and other people I know who ordered around the same time received theirs in about 3-4 weeks.  You only have the absurd waiting list if you want the $35k lower battery life model.

&#x200B;

(2) There's no buying a new car BS when you deal with Tesla.  As some have referenced in this thread, some people just buy the car online or on their phones.  There's no haggling, and everyone who buys one pays the same price walking out the door.  The car sells itself.  I test drove the Model 3 and bought the car the same day because I knew I didn't have to engage in a song and dance to get the best price.

&#x200B;

(3) The car is extremely fast and fun to drive.  I didn't get the Performance model (I think it was around $10k more) and my car goes 0-60 in under 5 seconds.  The Performance model goes 0-60 in ~~2.8~~  3.3-3.5 seconds.  Beyond the pure speed though, the torque and acceleration are really what makes the car a pleasure to drive.  It's the only car I've ever been in where it feels like you're immediately being blown back in your seat when you gun it.  Even the best performing sports cars have a little ramp up and you feel the gears shifting as it's ramping up.  It's definitely an odd feeling but very fun if you've never driven an electric car.

&#x200B;

(4) The car is miles ahead of everything else in hardware and tech.  The cool thing is because it's so software-based, the car becomes more advanced overnight in my garage while installing a new software update.  A new update came out right after I got my car and the car suddenly had new features that it did not previously have.  For example, I can now use my phone to pull the car into and out of my garage if I wanted to.  I have a small driveway, so kind of an unnecessary feature for me, but it's cool that it works that way.  As mentioned, I also live in LA, so deal with a decent amount of traffic getting to work.  The Enhanced Autopilot has completely changed my commute.  This is basically self-driving on freeways.  You set how many seconds you want to keep between you and the car in front of you (e.g. 1 second in the case of stop and go traffic near downtown LA or 4 seconds if you're cruising at higher speeds) and the max speed you want the car to go.  The car will speed up and slow down, take curves (autosteering) for you and will even switch lanes if you signal.  The car is also capable of full self-driving, so once that becomes legal it will simply be a software upgrade to get that working.

&#x200B;

(5) The car is just constructed extremely well.  I used to drive a 3 series BMW and man the Tesla just blows it away in every category.  Also, the warranty is the best I've ever seen.  It really shows you how much faith they have in the car.  The two major functional components of the car are the motor and the battery, both of which come standard with a 8 year, 120,000 mile warranty.  Everything else bumper to bumper is 4 years, 50,000 miles.  It's really laughable how much better that is than what you can get from BMW or Mercedes, for example.  My 3 series had issues from the first year I got it until I finally dumped it.  Everything was put together horribly and everything was absurdly expensive to get fixed.  And that warranty was 3 years, 30,000 miles for everything.  Because there are relatively less parts too, I've read that people have relatively less issues.  It's just the issues get a lot more attention because Tesla is a new company.  There are no stories about people paying $10k to fix critical issues in their BMWs 4 years after purchase.

&#x200B;

Lots of unsolicited advice, but really has been the first time I've been excited to drive in ages.

The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.

I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here.

Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow

But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.

It’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. 

So they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.

However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.

So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  

OR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.

Either way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. 

If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.

Obviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip.

Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. 

In the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. 

The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point.

As I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.

I like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.

That’s my hope anyways.

1. I mean this is a common criticisms of stock buy backs

In general a company does well, it makes a ton of cash then the question is what to do with the cash and well one answer is return it to the owners

Well at the same time because the company is doing well and making a ton of cash the market has pushed it stock price up because well its a good company making a ton of cash

So yea a common criticism of buy backs is they happen when the stock price is high because that usually is also when the company is making a ton of cash and has free cash flow to return it to investors

I guess a potential alternative is just to declare special dividends and return the cash via a special dividend but that also comes with taxes for the owners
2. I'm not a big fan of buybacks or dividends in a company that is still growing quickly, I'd rather see cash reinvested into the business. 50B sounds like a lot, but this is a company worth 3T. 50B is roughly 1.6% of float, not exactly a big impact. 

This company is being priced at insanely high growth expectations, use the cash to meet and exceed those expectations, not to bolster short term share value
3. I have owned NVDA stock for years. The stock buy back is essentially taking profits and putting them in Jensen and other employees pockets via their stock options.  I don’t have a problem with that because they have built the company from the ground up. 

The hyper growth is over but I believe NVDA can still outperform the 500 for a few years.
4. IMO they would be better off using the cash to acquire companies than repurchasing their own shares at inflated valuations.

1. A lot of people in this thread talking about regretting selling stocks. One maneuver I frequently make when I feel a stock is doing really well, but perhaps either becoming too large of a percentage for my portofolio -or- I feel the stock might be way over valued, I’ll just sell a portion of the stock I own (maybe 25%, 50%, 75%, etc.). Then, if the stock really takes off (again), I’ll still get a great return and I’ll avoid the fear of missing out.  Alternatively, if it dumps, I won’t be losing nearly as much.

Not an uncommon strategy, but just wanted to remind some folks! I did this today with AAPL. I think I maybe sold like 10% of my shares.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

""During my routine DD (due diligence) yesterday regarding AMD institutional and insider holdings/purchases/sales I stumbled upon something very interesting. It seems on Aug. 29th an AMD board member director named Nicholas Donofrio PURCHASED 69,100 shares at $7.68 per share equaling ~$530,000 ! [Yahoo Finance](https://biz.yahoo.com/t/16/4114.html) , [Nasdaq link](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/insider-trades), [direct pdf of SEC filing](http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TVRFeE56WXdOQ1p6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1BZHZhbmNlZE1pY3JvRGV2aWNlc180XzIwMTYwODMwLnBkZg==)

This is interesting and important because while it's common for executives to receive free stock options as part of their normal compensation package (and sell some of those free stocks to finance a purchase of a car or new roof, college tuition, whatever) it's unusual for a PURCHASE to occur, let alone one to occur BEFORE a stock offering and the Global Foundries amendment.

So what's going on? Why would this director purchase essentially on the open market RIGHT BEFORE A STOCK OFFERING?! $7.68 per share corresponds with the Aug. 29th trading day range. The director Nicholas Donofrio is also no dummy.

Nicholas Donofrio is currently on the board of AMD, on the board of New York Melon Bank, on the board of Delphi automotive, he was also on the board of IBM for many years, along with a regents board member for Connecticut. By all accounts Nicholas Donofrio is well versed in finance, in technology, and from his stock compensation the last 20 years VERY well versed in trading.

So what makes him so confident that he would be willing to purchase at $7.68 DESPITE knowing a stock offering and Global Foundries amendment were just about to be released which would undoubtedly impact the stock negatively?

My assumption is he is extremely confident in either Zen, Polaris, or perhaps even Q3... The timing of the purchase is very peculiar. He could have easily purchased after the stock offering, he could have easily purchased after Q3 (if he assumed Q3 would be negative). But instead he choose to purchase at nearly the 52 week high.. So what does this guy know that we don't?

Given the guy is VERY wealthy so perhaps half a million dollars is of no consequence to him. However if you look over his trading history, you will notice he has made VERY FEW purchases with his own money in the last 2 years all between $4,000-5,500 which frankly is chump change. At $530,000 AMD is definitely the outliner here. He also routinely receives free AMD stock through normal compensation package, why purchase on his own?
But why have no articles been released on this? Why is this the first I'm hearing of this and had to find it myself? Normally this is news that is published immediately. It's quite perplexing to me to say the least.
My only guess is he purchased at the high to prevent any accusations of insider trading (which he was accused of but never convicted of during his time with IBM). No one is going to accuse him of trading on insider information if he buys at the high right before a major stock offering. It's also extremely unlikely that a board member wouldn't know about a stock offering and the Global Foundries amendment. Board directors are the first to hear about this kind of thing and this must have been in the works for at least some time.

So what gives? What am I missing from this equation? What is everyone's thoughts on this?""

1. >while it's common for executives to receive free stock options as part of their normal compensation package it's unusual for a PURCHASE to occur

What is he talking about? Insider buying is really common. Like, really really common.

The whole post is written as if it's a surprise. This happens all the time. It's also somewhat of a poor indicator, as many insiders have terrible timing when buying stock. Unless it's [Jamie Dimon](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-05/jamie-dimon-made-one-of-the-year-s-best-trades). This dude knows exactly what his stock is worth.
2. It's really not that complicated. Look at the footnotes on the Form 4 filing. He took the shares out of a trust he owns. The transaction code on this is ""J"" which is a distribution, not an open market purchase.

He couldn't purchase them in the open market, that would be insider trading.

3. ALL IN. WSB REPRESENT
4. Does anyone know what the equity requirements for the board members of AMD are or if there were recently any changes? While board members are commonly compensated with a mix of cash and stock options, which partially ties their compensation to the performance of the company, it's not uncommon for their to be equity requirements of board members.

While Nicholas Donofrio is not a new appointment, it may have been found in an audit that he didn't meet the necessary equity requirements, and had to increase his holdings. An adjustment to the equity requirements may have also prompted an increase in holdings.

1. But high, sell low. I think you're looking for wsb
2. Today? Hold unless you need rent money. 
3. AMD bounces around a bit, at least wait until it pops some, but the chart doesn't look like it will go to $15 again anytime soon . . .
4. If you plan on holding a stock long-term and it's not long-term promising, it needs to be giving you income.  AMD doesn't pay dividends but there are other ways to do this.

Your username is spot on.  You've got several options here, which you can sell for cash.

Let's assume you have 100 shares, since you say this is 30% of your position, and your other post says you have 5k in your active trading brokerage account.  For the sake of simplicity, let's also assume the stock's volatility stays the same.

One thing you could do is sell slightly OTM (say, like 2 strikes away from ITM) covered calls on your position until you get assigned, which *does* have a non-zero probability happening within your lifetime.  If you sell, say, a May 18 12C at 0.52, that's $52 of income for holding 2 months.  So it would take unfortunately 1.25 years (16 months) to collect $416, which would bring your investment back up to the break-even point.  Annualized, this would be 20.8%.  If you do this, you'd also need to account for the fact your AMD shares might then be considered a long term investment, which gives you a long term capital loss when sold (if you do sell or get assigned below breakeven, after a year) while income from selling options would always be taxed at ordinary income rates.

If you don't like AMD and want to get out faster but forfeit the possibility of making a profit, use a 2:1 ratio call spread,  which would essentially be like selling covered calls and buying a debit call spread.  The proceeds from the one contract covers the cost of the long leg of your spread, making this a net debit, which means no risk but decreases the breakeven point without adding more capital.

1x May 18 12 @ .51

-2x May 18 13 @ .30

- Let's say the price on May 18th is 11: Both 13s expire worthless, so you pocket $60 of premium, and the 12 expires OTM and you've lost $51.  Net +$9.
- Let's say the price on May 18th is 12: Both the 13s expire worthless and you pocket $60 of premium, the 12 expires ATM and you've lost $51.  Still net +$9.
- Let's say the price on May 18th is 13: Both the 13s expire ATM, and so you get the $60, get assigned, and the 12 expires ITM and you've gained $49.  Net $109.  You also get (12-10.75) * 100 = $125 from the proceeds of the sale, for a total of $60 + $49 + $125 = $234 to get out of your position.  That, vs. (13-10.75) * 100 = $225.

Etc...

It doesn't seem like this is helping much, but you're reducing the risk of more downside by simply holding and waiting.  Even in the worst case scenario, you make $9.

Of course all this is nice but might not be practical, because you need to account for commissions, since we're working with such a low dollar value here.

[Read this for more info about ratio spreads for stock repair](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/stock-repair-strategy.aspx), but just beware, it's not as good in practice as the article makes it sound.

Additionally, your brokerage might have a program you could participate in that will give you the ability to loan out your shares to other people, so you could collect interest on that while you wait for something to happen to enhance your yields.  Typical rates are like 7-8%, and you'd get 50% of that, so add 3.5-4% annual returns on top of other strategies discussed should you decide to do this.
5. Congratulation, you bought at one of the worst possible moment!

Depending on

(a) how soon you'll need your funds

(b) how comfortable you are with unrealized losses, and with further unrealized losses

(c) the rest of your holdings

It may or may not be a good idea to buy more.

I wouldn't take the loss yet, unless you need money and you are overexposed on the name.

If it makes sense to YOU personally: when the recent downcycle is near the exhaustion ($10?) you should look to buy some shares, average down your price, and then trim back your position if hopefully it gets up near $12. This is easier to be said than done though...",23-03-2018 12:15

I’ve been accused of being a booster for Nvidia. And I’ve definitely been posting a lot on it. But it is, according to Goldman Sachs, “the most important stock in the world.”

And we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. 

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. 

So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective. 

From MarketWatch opinion piece:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-is-the-magnificent-1-now-but-these-rivals-are-closing-in-3a382a8b?g=7cca269b-40cb-4e86-a320-c716dfd46439&mod=djem_mwnbulletin

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. 

Top Comments:
1. As a Nvidia bear at this price, although I’m holding my long time shares, I believe Nvidia has three main strengths to hold back competition and three weaknesses to its pricing power long term. 

1. CUDA (software & support). 
2. Best performance even excluding CUDA. 
3. First mover advantage (biggest network, most capital). 

Weaknesses I believe are getting bigger although the rate at which they are may not matter in an AI world assuming AI turns out to be the new iPhone or internet. 

1. High margins inspire competition (AMD, Intel, Huawei). 
2. High exposure to capital rich buyers (vertical alternatives like TPU and Maia). 
3. High risk of shift from LLM training to LLM inference as model training scale diminishes in improvement (lowering need for full replacement of prior generation with cutting edge hardware).

I’d place high exposure to capital rich buyers as the primary concern for Nvidia’s long term pricing power. Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Oracle. All are the biggest buyers and have decent SOC design teams. They can quite literally spend 90% of an H100 on an alternative and still save 2-3% since the margin is currently 93% on H100. $38.5k is Nvidia margin. 

That means the incentive to make an alternative ASIC AI accelerator is huge. And they exist. 
More so, inference is what we do once we finish training an LLM. And inference tends to perform reasonably well in price/performance on non-peak hardware. 
You need the latest greatest Blackwell 100 for training GPT5 and Gemini 2. Do you need it to inference with efficient 7b versions of them?
2. ""This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.""

These pundits think they know.  Certainly seems logical.   But the truth is the longer Nvidia is left unchallenged the harder it is to displace them.   TPU has been around since 2015, 9 years and Nvidia just get's bigger and more formidable.    They are moving on new businesses, new consumers, new workloads, new discovery every day, so their footprint just gets larger.

""single source""

yeah, what a shame that never worked out for Intel
3. No opinion on Nvidia, but the idea that it saved a sinking market is incorrect. Earnings have beat expectations across the board, this bull run is quite wide (see Russell 2000 up 22% since the bottom), real wages are above inflation (this one makes some people mad for some reason)... Bottom line, this bull market is real, with or without Nvidia. Now, is it helping the narrative, quite possibly.

Even more evidence is all time highs in several international markets, the notorious NIKKEI 225 being one among them.
4. You know which company has made me more gains than Nvidia?

Dick's Sporting Goods.

DKS is growing even faster than NVDA. Don't ask me why.
5. There is also a a startup call groq not to be confuse with grok from

2. I was very surprised to see that as well. Anybody here been keeping track of AMD? What happened
3. For people debating purchasing this based on the demand for high-end AMD graphics cards caused by cryptocurrency mining, please keep in mind that AMD's entire discrete desktop graphics market is just 7.1% of their sales.  [Here's a good chart that breaks down AMD's various divisions and their cumulative value to the company.](http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=AMD.trefis&from=search#/AMD/n-1360?from=sankey)

Also please note that specific card popularity directly affects the manufacturer's sales, of which AMD only gets a small cut.  Take a look at Gigabyte and MSI's charts over the last few months and you can truly see the effect that crytpcurrency mining has gained for them.

As a litecoin miner myself I share the love for these cards, but you have to remember that it's really only the 7900s/R9 2XXs that are getting sold out, which represent only a fraction of the high-end PC market.  Absolutely do not let your enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies affect your logical ability to determine if a stock is worth purchasing.

The use of AMD chipsets in consoles, whilst representing a significant number of units, is likely done on contract and has long since been priced into the stock (look how far it has risen in the past year already).
4. It will go up as long as mining cryptocurrencies is popular (I think their value to society is a discussion for another thread). AMD graphics card out hash Nvida by a factor of 2-3 for a comparable gaming card. This has lead to shortages of AMD Radeon cards and this can only help the share price rise.

If anyone wants more info as to why this has not happend sooner (Bitcoin has been around for 5 years), it's because there is a new type of mining. Bitcoin uses SHA256 mining and ASIC miners are the best at that job, the newer coins like Litecoin, Dogecoin and Coinye use Scrypt mining and this type of mining can be done very efficiently on an AMD GPU, hence the sudden increase in demand.

1. I see Amazon crossing Apple in market in the long term. So Apple.
And NVDA because I feel like it is better suited to compete against INTC
2. I would go Amazon over Apple because I see Amazon doing many more things and disrupting more industries so they have a lot of growth potential.

Nvidia over AMD. Have used both of their products and they are both just wonderful and it is very hard to pick clear winner. I have had slightly better experience with Nvidia so I believe that they can attract more customers. I guess this really comes down to slight bias that I see a lot more Nvidia products around me compared to AMD.

I would honestly like all of these but you made me choose.
3. 
I'm much more confident that companies like MSFT, INTC, WMT, and FB, who are relatively cheaper priced can maintain their multiple and the subsequent required growth for the next 10 years. And they haven't really experienced multiple expansion like AMD, AMZN, AAPL, and NVDA. 

Intel is extremely undervalued for the business they do. They are losing market share in the consumer base but server market share still remains 95%. I'm much more comfortable investing in with them who make $20B net income & ~10 P/E over AMD. These companies you mentioned are riding in extremely high multiples and for them to maintain that for 5-10 years is more than challenging. 

All great companies but they already priced at high growth. Very hard to pick one that is gonna grow more than projected.
4. jus buy 4 of them.. you will make gains on all..
5. I got a share in all but I lean on AMZN and NVDA much more than others.

NVDA has the future in cloud, AI and autonomous driving.

China can try to copy hardware tech (especially since Tesla has its gigs factory there) but chips are a totally different matter. china can't catch up its chip manufacturing for decades.",26-09-2020 21:42
it82ic,investing,"Post: Packaging Deep Dive - the overlooked battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC

 This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my blog and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

48mncq,investing,"Post: AMD - playing the hype

I've been fascinated watching AMD oscillate between 1.85 and 2.2 for the past few weeks. It's been a day-trading dream really (especially given its accessible price).

Today I'm seeing more strength.  I know the company has shaky fundamentals but the new Zen architecture has had a lot of good hype and it seems to be gaining.  If Zen is what they say it is (we'll see) - AMD may actually be viable again in the CPU business.

In the GPU business, AMD is performing solidly in the VR space. Nvidia may ""win"" but there is room for a strong 2nd place finisher.

Any further thoughts on a 2016 play into the stock?

1. I've gotten to the point where I believe AMD is secretly being kept afloat by Intel to preserve the illusion of competition and avoid regulation.
2. Assume you are the last one to learn about what's hot and what's not in the industry. Invest accordingly.
3. Sometimes I forget AMD even exists, tbh. 
4. Wow. You guys know how to make a newbie feel welcome !   Sorry for the stupid question!

Top Comments:
1. They have there new CPUs coming out in the next few months. the CPUs look to do very well against their competition
2. Intel states in it's 10-k it wants out of personal computing and to shift into server space. Intel is literally giving AMD market share. Sounds like you can bank on AMD increasing revenues.
3. Can you explain why it looks overvalued?
4. Intel is having supply shortages
5. To preface: I've been buying AMD since it was \~$2, and continue to buy. I'll likely stop around $30 / share.

Their chip design is just better. The way they designed their dies are scale-able, as chip size decreases, they can add more units without redesigning the chips much (if at all).

Meaning, as the 7nm and 5nm process from TSM starts rolling out, AMD is going to be more performant and more importantly \*cheaper\* and \*lower power\* than Intel. This is huge for the enterprise market, which is already testing AMD due to the security bugs in Intel chips last year. Currently, Intel cannot fix their chips and there's a 30% performance reduction because of it. At the very least, this will lead to cloud providers diversifying (which helps AMD gain market share)

So, *I highly suspect* cloud providers will be moving a larger percentage of their instances to AMD based chips. In addition, the performance increase and reduced power will be excellent for both desktops and laptops. Will, AMD take the whole market? Probably not, but perhaps it'll take 30%-40% of the market over the next 2-3 years. That'll probably 2-4x revenue from their CPU line. If Intel cannot answer AMD due to a delay in their manufacturing process or inventory, Intel will lose even more market share to AMD.

That's not including AMD coming out with improved GPUs and/or coming out with their version of CUDA. If they do that, we can see AMD take market share from Nvidia as well. *I highly suspect* they will do that in the gaming market, and that's part of the Google Stadia project.

Finally, AMD integrated GPUs beat out Intel and ARM, for now. For laptops this is a pretty big perk, and companies such as Lenovo are now selling AMD based laptops again. If AMD again can come out with an answer to CUDA, this could be a massive advantage as their integrated GPUs.

In other words, they are extremely well positioned.",05-04-2019 01:52
dynong,investing,"Post: AMD thoughts

What do you guys think about this AMD run, I have a sizeable portion of my account to AMD (and NVDA). While I believe in the stock long term this P/E is getting a bit out of hand and I've been burnt on AMD's run and fall before.

Top Comments:
1. I sold half of my AMD holdings at this point. Still holding half for long term. If it dips, I will likely add. This current run up will likely not be sustainable.
2. It's a great time to take some profit if you're looking at it short term. It's also a great company to buy and hold for a few more years. Zen 3 is positioned amazingly well for consumer and datacenter, GPU market share can only really improve from its abysmal level, and semi-custom revenue starts hitting the books soon.

Hold is probably the best overall answer, but you should rebalance if your AMD holdings are getting out of hand due to the run up.
3. I like to just let my winners ride. Been burned too many times by selling a winner because the multiple got large just for the stock to rise 10x over the next 5 years.
4. Wait till server sales start going through.. That will be the game changer for AMD. These happen on a longer time scale and people are expecting their market share in server to really take off.
5. If you are worried about a short term loss you could purchase a put to limit losses in the event of downturn, while still holding the shares and profiting overall.",19-11-2019 17:36

bi1x4m,investing,"Post: why do stocks like AMD, TSLA have so much volatility?

Compared to INTC and Ford for example.

Top Comments:
1. With bigger variation in a companies cashflows the volatility of its stock price increases.

So why are the cashflows varying much more for AMD than they do for INTC?
Percentage value of future cashflows.

For INTC and Ford the current cashflows are a big part of the cashflows that are expected in the future. Investors expect TSLAs and AMDs cashflow to grow way faster than INTCs and Fords. With this growth there comes a lot of uncertainty aswell. Every factor that changes currently (interest rates, GDP growth, Trade deals) will have a much bigger impact on growing cashflows thant it has on stagnant cashflows. So growth companies will face a much bigger volatilty since those factors play a stronge role for them.
2. Half of folks are Tesla bag holders who think Tesla is the future (me, lololo) and half think Elon is a crack pot who is about to be bankrupt
3. These are considered ""growth"" companies. Where prices are thought to be low now, but there is a chance for huge growth and profits for the owners. As such, these companies tend to see huge multiples in PEs on speculation, but if the tiniest piece of bad news comes out, then suddenly it's going to look way over priced compared to the risk and people will sell.

Conversely, good news will seem confirm that the speculators were right and people will pile on hoping to get in before its too late.
4. Layman here. Just looking real quick at the company sizes, AMD had a 2018 revenue of 6.48B and 10k employees, Intel 70B and 100k employees. Tesla had a revenue of 21.4B and 45k employees, Ford 160B and 199k. There's a huge gap in size so I would infer that size=stability.
5. AMD and Tesla have more growth opportunities so small changes in projected growth rates have a larger effect on enterprise value.    
    
Right now they are discounted at a much higher cost of capital and therefore even small changes in growth prospects have a disproportionate amount of impact on enterprise value.    
    
They are also both highly levered which means that small changes in cash flows have a more significant impact to equity investors (so is Ford but that's a different story).",27-04-2019 18:18

Looking back at reddit posts in 2008

I was a teenager during the housing crisis but it didn't feel like too long ago. I found some salient posts that highlight the sentiment around this time. History will repeat itself one day but the million dollar question is when. I also just watched The Big Short and as a result became an experienced speculator.

1. I invested all the way down and back up.  Just kept doing bi-weekly max 401k contributions and $500 per month into Roth.  Yes, it was painful sometimes... really painful.  I didn't look at my 401k for months at a time since it was automatically put into my choices.  I had to look at Roth though in order to invest what I deposited.

I knew to never panic sell and that buying when the market was crashing was the best thing to do.  It certainly was in this case.  When the market recovered, I had great gains and went on to retire in 2016 at age 52.

ci3y3j,investing,"Post: Is right now a good time to invest in AMD?



Top Comments:
1. I'm long on AMD at any price, but I wouldn't buy with an expectation of a short term profit taking right now.
2. Tough call, I'd say it will mostly depend on if Intel manages to fix 14 nm production and if they manage to finally succeed at 10 nm.  AMD is propped up a lot right now because they released solid Zen processors while Intel is facing shortages of production and delays, allowing AMD to secure some market share.

On a smaller side, it will also depend if they can catch up on GPUs with NVIDIA.

I just hate myself rn because I was considering buying when AMD was under $2 because I saw potential in crypto mining to prop up their earnings, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting up a brokerage account :(
3. Im in and im waiting for a drop to invest more
4. The company is coming off a bunch of successful products. The Ryzen 3000 series has been well received not only for its performance per watt numbers but also its performance per dollar numbers. The 5700 and 5700XT graphics cards are amazing value for the money. I expect them to sell well.

However, all this is priced into the stock right now. It is trading at a 100+ PE which is rare or unheard of in the semiconductor world. I guess you can say that the growth expectations are priced into it. 

At this point, I would not recommend buying it. Maybe if there is a drop after earnings, that would be a good time to get in.
5. I went in on it. The earnings report is coming out in 4 days and they've got a pretty big edge of intel. I'm a little biased though, i build a ryzen 7 haha",26-07-2019 15:01
1w1z6e,investing,"Post: AMD - Where will it bottom out?

So AMD has been dropping day after day since the earnings report this week. Any predictions to when that will bottom out and turn around again?

I'm convinced it will turn around but not sure at what point. Definitely whish I didn't hold on earnings day. I'm still holding now cause I bought pretty low months ago and I even bought in a bit more yesterday cause I thought it was turning at 3.60 but now its below 3.50. 

Any guesses?

Top Comments:
1. It will bottom out with bankruptcy.
2. You know, I see a lot of people treating cryptocurrency mining as some sort of x-factor that will push AMD to the moon but I just don't feel it... It's such a small, micro niche market with so few players, I just don't see how it would impact the overall sales of the company in any significant way.
3. Complete guess with no reasoning, so don't ask for any.  It'll slide for a month or two and settle around 2.50.  

If you learn anything from this, it's don't hold shares after earnings on AMD, at least not until it proves that it won't drop 10-12% the day after.

11eyb9,investing,"Post: AMD at an all time low!!!

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 14.38% yesterday. Share value is at $2.74 as of now, and that's the lowest it's been since 2009.
 Reason behind the price drop, according to sources, is that PC demand has drastically lowered, while tablet demand is soaring. AMD specializes in making computer chips, and with the demand for computers lowering, so does their revenue. In fact, they're in such a rut, they're going to lay off around 10% of their workforce. 
I see this as a perfect opportunity for investment. I expect the value to drop a bit more, since there are no current signs of improvement. 
For all of you ""Buy Low, Sell High"" investors, here's a great target.

4. You have to ask yourself why won't it keep going lower...and frankly I have no answer, which is why I'm not buying AMD. Honestly, I'd rather short AMD than buy.
5. Here's the thing with AMD, they have yet to be able to prove that they can continue competing against companies like Intel. Intel has already mastered the 22nm chip and is already seeing promising results with 3D FINFET transistors, AMD is  struggling to get good results in 22nm and their hopes for 3d transistors are still years away even if they can manage to survive until then, they will still be very behind Intel.",13-10-2012 14:43
1fbqg84,investing,"Post: Warren Buffett’s first rule of investing never made sense to me?

I’ve never understood Warren Buffett’s first rule of investing: “never lose money.” To me, it’s like saying, “the first rule of personal safety is not to die.” Or that the first rule of dieting is not to gain weight. 

It seems overly simplistic and vague. Instead, it would be far more useful if he specified how to avoid losing money—just as general safety tips are more helpful for staying alive than simply saying, “don’t die” or to give me diet and exercise tips than to tell me not to gain weight. 

What do you think? Or is there another explanation to this, since this is Buffett we are taking about amd there is a lot of thought process behind what he says and does. Ty


Top Comments:
1. It's actually very smart advice. People focus on making money while investing, while the rule #1 for pro investors is never, ever, exposing your assets to any type of medium to high risk.
2. never lose money = don't yolo = don't fomo = dd 

it's an obvious statement similar to ""buy low sell high"".  easy to say but difficult to execute 🤷‍♂️
3. He's referring to margin of safety. Buying assets that are undervalued rather than fomoing into overvalued ones.
4. Loss prevention is better than making profit.
5. It’s about ergodicity—playing the long game rather than the short game.

You may beat me for a week, six months, or even a year playing options, but your strategy is so risky that you’ll lose it all on year 2, meanwhile my basket of relatively non-risky bets have been compounding.

How many people have become billionaires off of playing options on earnings?

I actually think there are more aggressive ways for small investors to play the same doctrine—investing in nano to mid caps that have solid balance sheets, big growth potential, and cash flows now or in the near future (as in, the cash flows have been committed by counterparties). Some will inevitably lose, but enough sound bets will pay off (80/20 rule).

Some may disagree on the previous paragraph and that’s fine. But in sum I feel Buffett’s point is about capital preservation—don’t risk everything for something you can live without, and don’t chase short-term gains at the expense of long-term returns.",08-09-2024 05:24

Looking for competitors in the AI space or companies whose products/services NVDA needs to keep pushing its AI further. Not looking to make quick money - was wondering if there are reputable companies that fit these criteria for the medium or long haul. Also not looking for true start ups. Thoughts?

Top Comments:
1. Think of it this way: There are hundreds of applications of AI, but everyone’s going need compute. So, MSFT & AMZN for their cloud, NVDA & AMD for their chips, MU for memory, TSM & ASML for manufacturing (you can even bet on the tech consulting domain!)

>Following NVIDIA’s positive first fiscal report, green stocks have hit an all-time time high of $361 per share. A few days back,[ *NVIDIA reported its first-quarter earnings*](https://www.hardwaretimes.com/nvidia-posts-a-solid-q1-as-data-center-revenue-grows-by-80-yoy-to-1-billion-gaming-by-27/),  satiating both investors as well as industry analysts. NVIDIA’s overall  revenue grew by 39% YoY, bolstered by a strong data-center business and  a healthy gaming market. Both markets saw notable gains, but the former  was the highlight with a massive growth of 80% YoY, crossing the $1B  mark for the first time.

Top Comments:
1. Sold everything on friday for a good 110$ profit per share. Was put off by how fast NVIDIA grew in such a short amount of time, though only time will tell if i'll regret it.
2. NVDA was one of the first stocks I bought when I got into investing back in 2010 when I was just a sophomore in college. I knew NVDA was gonna be a good investment but @~12/ share I had no clue just how good it was going to be. 10 years later and I’m still sitting on the original investment plus all the dividends were reinvested over the years so this has become my all time best investment at around 2,400%! I’ll probably hold NVDA for next 20 years as I see no slowing down to their growth and only more catalysts for their products. 

As data centers become the hub for computing and desktop and laptops just become a portal to a server in a cloud NVDA is at the top of companies to benefit from this trend. I think they will also excel because of their investments in self driving AI and partnering with genomics for DNA sequencing.
3. Will it be able to sustain this trajectory? I am unsure if this is cheap or expensive stock? Thoughts?
4. I’m new to investing, so take it with a grain of salt, but a traditional metric is to look at the p/e ratio, the price per share relative to the earnings, which in the case of NVDA is around 67, which is considered high, basically implying a lot of future growth.

Check some other companies and see how their p/e relates to that of NVDA (obviously this is just one metric, but it ll get you started somewhere)

You need to ask yourself if their core businesses, datacenter, gaming, AI, will grow at such a level that these valuations are justified, not to forget how NVDA will operate in comparison to it s competion, Intel, AMD etc

I myself believe these markets will only get bigget and bigger, but to what extent I don’t know, so my outlook with this stock is 3-5 years.

Is this a “fair” price for the stock? Probably not.
What’s the fair price and will it come down to those levels? Who knows. 

Are you considering long term, i would say go

Short to medium term i would say there s so much uncerfainty now, covid, us china tension that these circumstances might be a catalyst for a prolonged downturn where NVDA def would be adversely effected, making it a no.

Read their 10k, quarterly earnings (10q i believe) and get knowledgeableon the company.

Nintendo Switch is STILL selling like crazy and that's running on nVidia's Tegra X1.

748ui9,investing,"Post: stockAday: can AMD overcome the apathy? $AMD

Today we are looking back at $AMD, a stock we totally missed in June 2016. Sorry.

When the stock was at $5 we asked: [Is there hope for AMD, long-term?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/4p0kg7/is_there_hope_for_amd_longterm_amd/) Clearly, yes, with the stock at $13 today.

Back then we concluded:

> In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 88%. That's despite revenues in the March quarter off 19% to $832M. Personally I am at a loss as to why the strong performance. 

What happened next? At the June quarter AMD stopped going backwards, sales rose single digits. In Sept quarter it was double digit growth. And the stock rose steadily as high as $15 in Feb.  

So what next?

# First the basics

|Ticker|[AMD](https://stockflare.com/stock/amd.o)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Semiconductors
Latest price | $13.42
Value | $12,706M
Daily vol | $969M
Date | 04 October 2017
Financials | [SEC Filings](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=amd&type=10&dateb=&owner=include&count=10)
Website | [http://www.amd.com](http://www.amd.com)

# How's the story changed the last 12 months?

From declining sales and losses to double digit growth and profits, there's hardly a nicer turn around!

|$AMD|a year ago|today|change|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Price | $6.50 | $13.40| +115% | 
|Target price | $6.25 | $14.20 | +130% | 
|Sales forecast | $4.4bn | $5.0bn | +14% | 
|EPS forecast | $-0.03 | $0.10 | N/A | 
|PE ratio | -ve | 130x | n/a | 

And as with many tech stories, when the top line starts growing at double digit rates, the near term PE valuation looks ludicrous. We'll have to think long term!

# What's so exciting about AMD?

Well, they used to be the _also ran_ in the microprocessor industry. Always chasing Intel. And when it comes to graphics processing units, they were always chasing Nvidia. But substantial R&D over many many years has finally paid off... with a set of products that are starting to gain traction!

Though let's not get too excited, Intel and Nvidia are the behemoths in those two markets. And then there is ARM, now owned by Softbank.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,619M | -ve | -ve
Intel Corporation | $61,711M | 40% | 20%
NVIDIA Corporation | $8,344M | 34% | 44%

So they are still the _challenger_ even though the stock price has surged!

# How are the numbers looking?

As I said above, it's a turnaround story. 

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.4bn | $5.3bn | $5.5bn | $4.0bn | $4.3bn| $5.0bn | $5.7bn|
|EPS | $-1.60 | $-0.11 | $-0.53 | $-0.84 | $-0.60| $0.10 | $0.31|

The expectation is they can add $700m a year to the topline with some nice operational leverage. 

And just in case you are wondering about their ability to generate cashflow, well, there is over $500m of net debt on the books, so we shouldn't expect any cashflow to come back to us as dividends in the near future.

# Cheap, no.

Let's look at the figures for 2018, when AMD is expected to earn over 30 cents a share. At 40x earnings it's not a bargin, but if the moment is there, with market share gains and margin gains, it's not a shocking price.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMD.O | $12,706M | 40x | N/A | 0% | N/A
Peers |||||
INTC.O | $185,047M | 13x | 9% | 3% | 13%
NVDA.O | $107,622M | 45x | 12% | 0% | 2%
Other Semis |||||
TSM | $189,812M | 18x | 15% | 3% | 13%
AVGO.O | $97,711M | 15x | 18% | 2% | 6%
TXN.O | $89,044M | 22x | 10% | 2% | 8%
MU.O | $44,975M | 5x | N/A | 0% | 0%

If we do our standard back-of-the-envelope, assuming earnings go up 20 cents a year, i.e. $0.10 ,$0.30, $0.50... for 30 years and discount it as 8% then the net present value is worth over $20 a share.

And if we look at sales multiples it's trading on 3x in line with Intel and a substantial discount to NVDA at 13x.

So, the valuation doesn't look expensive, given the turn-around. Though clearly it is not a bargain.

# Watch out for dilution

Back in 2016 they issued a convertible. It's way in the money, with owners able to convert their debt at $8 a shares. The further the stock rises the bigger the next dilution to common stock holders. 

And on top of this they've a strategic investor who dumped stock in [August](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-mubadala-amd/abu-dhabis-mubadala-sells-second-stake-in-u-s-chipmaker-amd-idUSKBN1AK0NA) still has a substantial stake. So there is a headwind here, as these folks sell down.

# Wall Street doesn't care

The professionals on Wall Street have a $14.23 for AMD, i.e. a paltry 6% upside. Despite 4 quarters of double digit growth, their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. 

Though we have to remember that Wall Street has been in catch up mode for over 2 years, with a target price below the share price and a hold recommendation all the time. 

Seems that they, like me, missed the inflection point.

# Are we too late?

Fortune favors the brave. A year ago, you'd have been brave. 

Today, not so. I can see the potential to double my money within 5 years. If the current trends are sustainable. Though it's no longer a moonshot. 

If you are a believer in their market position vs Intel and Nvidia, then I can see why you'd be willing to buy. But if you think they are still a me-too chip maker, then best you stay away. 

Like a year ago, I'm stuck on the fence. I just don't understand the tech well enough to make that call. Sorry.

2. To complicate the analysis further, they've been issuing shares like candy to cover their R&D and operational costs to the tune of about 7% anually.  Until that stops, any investment in AMD has to grow EPs about that much just to break even.

4. AMD Vega 64 seems to be the strongest GPGPU compute chip under $1000, winning various benchmarks such as [BTC / ETH mining, Luxmark, Cinebench, VRAY, SPECapc](https://techgage.com/article/a-look-at-amds-radeon-rx-vega-64-workstation-compute-performance/4/). (Losing only to the NVidia Titan and other high-end compute chips)

But guess what? This is still an uphill battle for AMD.

1. Computing is just as much about tooling and programming as it is about hardware. OpenCL works just fine, but NVidia's CUDA tools are considered way better in programming circles, and have reached critical mass with regards to AI fields (TensorFlow, etc. etc.)

2. Video Gamers are saddened by Vega64's relatively weak gaming performance. Video Games don't need GPGPU compute performance: they need Frames per Second. In part, Vega64 is proof of AMD's weaker manufacturing capability. NVidia is able to output both a dedicated Compute Chip (The Titan) and a dedicated Video Gamer chip (the 1080 Ti), but AMD only has the engineering prowess to pick one.

I think I agree with AMD's long term strategy here. Video Gamers are a secondary market compared to the growing GPGPU community, and generally speaking a good Compute Chip will still be a decent Video Gaming chip. GPGPU compute is just way more profitable than video games. Professionals are willing to pay $3000+ per GPU, while even the most hardcore of Video Gamers really only pay up to $800 or so (with most Video Gamers opting for the $200 price point)

The next steps would be for AMD to release better tools to try and catch up to NVidia's strong lead with CUDA / Tensorflow / etc. etc. Vega64 has proven that it can go toe-to-toe in Compute, but without tooling it'd be difficult for AMD to thrive.

-------

A key development over the past year is Apple choosing AMD / OpenCL to be the GPGPU solution of the ""Mac Pro"" line. This isn't surprising, because Apple did create OpenCL after all (and AMD hopped on board later).

Still, if AMD can be a good 2nd place contender in GPGPU compute, I think they'd be in a good position. Plenty of markets are big enough for two companies: Pepsi and Coke... Yahoo and Gmail... Bing and Google.

We usually look down upon the underdog from an investing perspective, but its still potentially profitable.

------

Bulldozer wasn't that bad in the great scheme of things, but Intel really blew AMD out of the water with the release of ""Sandy Bridge"" chips. AMD had virtually no response for years, but now Intel has stopped innovating (years of only single-digit performance gains), finally giving AMD an opportunity to leap-frog a competitive product. 

RyZEN doesn't seem to be ""superior"" to Intel, but its a strong contender and the price is way cheaper than Intel. Between EPYC ($2000+ market), Threadripper ($500+ market), and RyZEN ($300ish market), AMD has positioned itself as a cheaper alternative to Intel. And its not really much worse than Intel's chips at all.

Intel still will have the laptop market on lockdown, because RyZEN doesn't have the power efficiency that Intel's chips have. But in server / workstation / desktop, AMD has made a serious contender.
5. I bought in at $13.48 a while back and it's barely hit that a few times. Probably going to jump into something with better growth for now. I expect it to grow eventually, but not at the same pace of other companies. I've made about 50% on NVDA in the same time frame. ",04-10-2017 15:23
ob0m9d,investing,"Post: Thoughts on buying XLNX before the merger with AMD is official

The title says it all really. I understand it as XLNX shareholders will get 1.73 shares of AMD once the merger is official (planned for end of 2021).

I’m long on AMD and think this is a good opportunity, but curious what others think? Right now AMD valued at 90, you’re getting a bargain with XLNX shares but I also understand both stock prices can go down/up to the point where its no longer beneficial.

Thoughts?

2. It is common for a company acquiring another to offer a premium to induce the board and shareholders to agree to the merger.   So the market price of the company being acquired will often spike upwards in response.

The merger is not guaranteed to be completed.  Various countries and various regulatory bodies must approve.  So there is a risk that the merger won't happen.  In that case the stock price is likely to sink back to near where it was when the merger was first announced, or perhaps just above the old price because the company is now ""in play"" and other merger or acquisition offers may materialize.

The difference between the stock price and the price of the post-merger value is a reflection of that uncertainty.   There may also be a small difference due to the company being acquired agreeing not to issue dividends prior to the merger.
3. Tiny upside (in case merger gets approved by every country), and a lot of downside (in case someone has an issue with it)
4. I agree and did buy XLNX instead of AMD. I'm comfortable with the risk.
5. Merger arbitrage is the term you're looking for. I consider it to be pretty low reward.",30-06-2021 16:13
lg297f,investing,"Post: Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio)

Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

# For those who keep asking for another round of tracking underrated stocks, I'll add a comment below to collect new picks to monitor.  Happy to update you on a similar cadence.

As a reminder, please do not interpret results seen here as an endorsement of the investing prowess of the community. Invest at your own risk.

5sh6m9,investing,"Post: Thoughts on buying AMD after the 20% jump in 3 days.

Ive been following this stock for a while now and recently the last obstacle has been removed. A potentially bad earnings report has been keeping people away from the stock. With it being out and beating expectation (slightly), and incoming Ryzen sales. It should be smooth sailing from now on unless some bad news about Ryzen is released. Another thing to note is Nvidia is releasing earnings on Feburary 15. If it is good expect AMD to go up with Nvdia, since these stocks have mirrored each other for a while now. Anyways this is my thesis. Thoughts?

Top Comments:
1. Why why why do people want to buy stock *after* it's had a huge jump. 
2. I hope there is a dip after earnings, I'll buy buy buy
3. If it dips enough I would want to buy. Wanted to hop in at ~$9 but pussied out. Stupid me eh?
4. So I actually picked up AMD a few months ago at a pretty decent price, and have made a suprising amount on it. However, I'm starting to get worried that a dip may be coming up. 
  
Nvidia and AMD have both been enjoying an increase in demand for processors and most likely will in the future (due to emerging technologies like augmented reality being integrated into new models of cars and such) but I'm not sure how many more jumps in price it will enjoy. Note, I don't work in finance, but I do watch technology trends at a research firm. 
5. Bulls know the value here, and the bump that will come after NVDAs ER. Smaller bears will get run over a 2nd time on Friday morning. Perpetual naysayers will jump in and the board will be filled with speculation that stock will drop back to $11/$10 like Dec. HOLD THE LINE",06-02-2017 21:48
5i3iqq,investing,"Post: $AMD to skyrocket. New $AMD GPUs vastly outperform Nvidia GPUs for the same price.

Overclock.net, WCCFTech, HardOCP, etc are all talking about jumping ship from Nvidia ($NVDA)/Intel ($INTC) to $AMD.
http://wccftech.com/amd-vega-performance-8gb-hbm2/

This is after today's reports from WCCFTech that $AMD's new GPU, the AMD RX490, which uses the new HBM2 3D-stacked DRAM interface manufactured by Samsung/Hynix, vastly outperformed the Nvidia GTX 1080.

This is actually huge news as most analysts were expecting the RX490 to just match the GTX 1080 in performance or only slightly exceed it. However, it exceeded it by a long shot.

$AMD will regain a huge portion of market share in the coming months, so I really expect $AMD to be at $20+ by end of 2017. Take this from a guy who knows a lot about the graphics card market. 

And now $AMD is starting to prove itself in the CPU front as well. If $AMD can just match $INTC in CPU performance:price ratio, it will lift $AMD up further, and drag $INTC down. 

Today's announcement may lead to high volatility, either up or down 5%. I think the result will be +5% in afterhours/pre-market tomorrow.

I don't see $AMD going below $9, and I think going below $10 will be quite difficult unless they really stuff the conference up.

EDIT: Just looking at $AMD's technical chart, we can see that every time it breaks through the $8~$10 level, it enters a huge bull market and reaches between $30~$40 in the following year/years. So $AMD may even triple or quadruple by the next 1-2 years. Yes, $AMD has increased by 800% over the past 1.5 years, however that does not mean that it can't increase by another 300~400%. Crazier things have happened before (think $AMZN, $NVDA, $TSLA and $NFLX). 

People tend to think that since $NVDA increased by 300% this year, $AMD should go up by about the same amount, not more. The markets are irrational guys. $AMD is still under $15, and market psychology suggests that companies with lower stock prices tend to have higher momentum.

>Take this from a guy who knows a lot about the graphics card market. 

The fatal flaw many Redditors on this sub encounter is thinking the fact that they know about graphics cards, video games, cpus, or whatever means they know about business and profitability.  
2. Where exactly did they mention the price of this GPU and since when does a handful of benchmarks determine ""vast outperformance""?

Please don't turn this sub into /r/buzzfeedinvesting.


3. Be careful maybe a sell the news type of situation. AMD is still a speculative play.
4. AMD seems like a one or two trick pony (CPU and GPU). While people who build PC's may go for AMD/ATI combination, the mass market tends to ignore AMD since they are not advertised. 90%+ of the computers advertised online and in stores like best buy are Intel / Nvidia. To say it will take a huge market share is a crazy overstatement and I believe way to opportunistic.

I am long AMD, don't get me wrong, I think there is still an opportunity here. I would not compare AMD to Nvidia. Nvidia has its hands in many different technologies and AMD will not be able to keep up.

MD's 2015 Q3 earnings report pointed to ongoing cash flow and profitability shortfalls.
The company's plans for new products such as the Zen CPU appear to be too little, too late.
AMD is in the grips of a classic death spiral, in which near-term measures only put more downward pressure on the company in the long term.

I'm a novice investor and only have about 2500 invested. I bought some amd stock at 145 hoping it would go up a little before their earnings report and I could sell and make a couple hundred. Right now the stock is sitting at 136 and has lost 10% in the last two days.

 Would it be better for me to just take the couple hundred loss or should I just ride the wave?

Top Comments:
1. Stocks are not  “get rich” easy scheme. If you could so easily invest into every stock right before the earnings and expect 10% gain every time this whole sub would be swimming in pools filled with cash. What you are describing is gambling. It’s not investing. I’m by no means an expert investor, but the way I see it you should just park your money in the market and leave it there for a minimum of 5 years and only sell if you absolutely need that money. It takes decades, but ultimately it should pay off. I’m sorry to be so blunt but this post really got to me for several reasons. Most of which I already described but also because AMD never does well after the earnings reports. So it’s really clear that you just dropped some money into a stock you probably know of because you are a gamer or are into computers and did not do any investigation on it. As I said. Put the money in the market and leave it there for the next several years at least. And most importantly continue to invest, diversify and read about investing. It’s already a good thing you start to invest, but investing will not make your life different in the short term or even in the medium term.
2. Don’t rush things ,leave the money there and be patient.
3. Tee hee
4. Did you look on financial reports of AMD before you had bought it?
5. You got some sage advice here, let me add my $.02 here, not just for you, but for anyone else reading this thread, and just starting out investing. 

1) Investing is a roller coaster of emotion, that swings between fear and greed. If you are in it long term, then the down swings are not so bad, and the up swings don't get you crazy excited. Just middle of the road, easy does it. In time, if you stick with it, you will come to understand this.

2) There are only 3 things that you need to do to successfully invest:

2a) Know what to buy.

2b) Know when to buy it.

2c) Know when to sell it.

Now I know this sounds like a wise guy, but I am being serious here. If you think about this every time you buy a stock, you will get better and better as time goes buy. Very little attention is paid to the last point by most investors.  When you are faced with a downturn, sometimes it is better to sell at a loss, take the money and invest into something else. Other times, it is better to wait out the downturn. There is no one size fits all answer for this situation, but the more you do it, the better you will get at making the right call.

3) Analyze all your mistakes. Learn from them. You paid mightily for that education, don't let it go to waste.

4) Learn as much as you can, and remember that you never stop learning. Get as many sources for market/economic info as you can, and soak them up every day/week/month/year. Education in investing is as important as the education you get for your work career. When I first started out, I struggled finding good sources of info. Over time, you will establish a BS filter/detector and be able to tune out the noise, and take in the nuggets. I will make one suggestion, not sure how others feel about this, but I find Blomberg TV to be invaluable. The experts they have on, are tops in their fields. They don't always get it right, but they are generally right, and generally not biased. I watch the recorded versions of ""Surveillance"" and ""The Open"" every night (to busy during the day when they are live, also I like to concentrate only on the show when I watch it, and I like to back-up and re-watch important segments). Note, you don't need a paid account to watch these videos, they are available on their phone app, or their website. CNBC is useful too, but they tend to be all about calling out stocks, while Bloomberg is more about discussing macro economic trends (which I find more important).

Best of luck to you, and stick with your investing, don't get discouraged.",05-01-2022 20:17
9rmobj,investing,"Post: $AMD is down 40% since the beginning of October, now below bear analysts estimate of $18.

While I understand the entire stock market has been tanking, it seem $AMD has 'corrected' the hardest. With Earnings report coming out Sunday, What is your out look on the immediate future of AMD? 

Top Comments:
1. Overreaction. They have plenty of fresh stuff in the pipeline. Intel is going to try to bite back a little harder but AMD has an edge: 7nm + better pricing.

On the GPU side, they won't compete with nVidia's high end until 2020 but they have good midrange products and 2/3 major game console design wins that should help them tread water.

There are a few other exciting things in the AMD pipeline as well.

They'll bounce back.

All major Semis will see some healthy gains in the near future.
2. Analysts are lagging indicators. Never listen to a damn thing they say. Even if they have the right logic, which is oftentimes a big if, they are always catching themselves in narratives that have more or less played out already.
3. I’ll buy at 6-7 ish
4. I follow semiconductors and I have a theory: Never invest in the 2nd place.

This year I thought AMD was the company to prove my theory wrong and I was about to admit defeat but maybe the theory still holds.

Here's what I mean: There are a lot of semiconductor companies but surprisingly little competition. This is because investment in semis is very very very expensive so most companies carve out a nice product or industrial segment. Some excel in analog, some in power, some in RF, some serve mostly autos, some mobile etc. What's more is the leader in each segment usually has a considerable lead on the 2nd place.

Now, you'd think this gives these companies a lot of pricing power but no. Semi customers have become ever more consolidated (or just plain large). Apple and Samsung for example, dictate a lot of pricing in the mobile space. This means being in the 2nd place is highly disadvantageous since you need a lot of cash to continue investing in the technology.

AMD is a good company with a lot of good people but they're in second place in their 2 main product portfolios. This really limits what they can do with their portfolio. They did pull a couple of good moves lately but it's really difficult to keep doing that in this industry.

One price-premium for 2nd place players has been the massive consolidation that had been going on in the industry the past 5 years. However, that came to an abrupt end with the QCOM-NXPI (and you can say AVGO-QCOM) deals being blocked for political reasons. So some of that price premium has disappeared too.

Anyway, I'd love to be wrong about AMD since I like the company and have a few good former colleagues who work there. I just wouldn't invest in it.

9txq6b,investing,"Post: AMD and NVDA: Future of AI

I am sorry for wording this like I had something important and revolutionary to say, but I want to bring something up. If AI is the future, and in order to train AI via machine learning, you need GPUs which are more effective than CPUs in this case, why are stocks of NVDA and AMD not increasing? Is it because of the recent news of chip demands going down?

Top Comments:
1. > NVDA and AMD stocks up  650% and 790% over the past 3 years  

> why are stocks of NVDA and AMD not increasing?  

Come on man...
2. The market for GPUs is mostly driven by other commercial interests (video game industry, bitcoin, VFX etc), AI is still a small field and is unlikely to move the needle that much. Furthermore, GPUs are not the only way to get accelerated epochs (training cycles, in ML speak) and there's some debate over whether GPUs are actually optimal hardware. Superior to CPUs, sure, but only because they can parallelize computations. 

Things to watch out for are the specialized processors (ASICS), such as the [TPU](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/an-in-depth-look-at-googles-first-tensor-processing-unit-tpu). Google cloud breaks down [when to use each type of processor](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tpus). If you check out the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator) you can see there's a lot of experimentation going on in the area. It is suspected that specific hardware for AI will need to be developed, and it is unclear if Nvidia or AMD are going to be the dominant players.

tl;dr the future is uncertain and will probably include a mix of general compute and specialized hardware and their use is based on model size. GPU vs CPU is only part of the story. 

You should do more research on this field, it's complex and there's lots going on.
3. Because GPUs are actually not the most ideal at training AI.  Specialized ASICS are far more efficient.
4. Nvidia’s stock has had a crazy ride up over the last couple of years. I don’t know why they’re doing what they’re doing in the short run, but the potential from AI is at least part of that crazy rise.

AMD has been doing well on the back of Zen, but as far as ML, pretty much everything in the deep learning world uses CUDA, and not OpenCL so far, so they’re left out in the cold. Right now it’s Nvidia or bust for GPU accelerated training.

3. finbox can suck my balls
4. As someone with an MBA, CFP and studying for my CFA, I've heard it all and I wouldn't put much into what finbox has to say. Machines understand numbers not narratives and AMD is a distressed, high-risk high-reward play whose current and future value is based on ""what is going to happen next"" and not on what has already happened.  

No less than Nvidia, Intel, Apple, and Facebook could realistically put AMD out of business, or alternatively, AMD could carve out a niche or have a tech breakthrough and quadruple in another 2 years.  It's hard to say which is which, but I can tell you that machines and AI are far behind the curve in terms of analyzing the market's sentiment, competition, and technological advances.

I'd pay much more attention to a machine's opinion on a stable earnings, high safety blue chip stock than I would a distressed small or mid cap company with a plethora of more important data points than fundamentals.

Hope this helps,

4. Nvidia is the leader in gaming GPU's and a lot more.

The expanding use of AI and data science is reshaping computing and data center architectures.With Mellanox, the new NVIDIA has end-to-end technologies from AI computing to networking, full-stack offerings from processors to software, and significant scale to advance next-generation data centers. Their combined expertise, supported by a rich ecosystem of partners, will meet the challenge of surging global demand for consumer internet services, and the application of AI and accelerated data science from cloud to edge to robotics.

By acquiring Cumulus Networks, NVIDIA can innovate and optimize across the entire networking stack from chips and systems to software including analytics like Cumulus NetQ, delivering great performance and value to customers. This open networking platform is extensible and allows enterprise and cloud-scale data centers full control over their operations. Cumulus, supports more than 100 hardware platforms with Cumulus Linux, its operating system for network switches. Their ultrafast NVIDIA Mellanox Spectrum switches already ship with Cumulus Linux and SONiC, the open source offering forged in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and managed by the Open Compute Project.

Simon Segars and his team at Arm have built an extraordinary company that is contributing to nearly every technology market in the world.

igz8q2,investing,"Post: AMD and the future

AMD's stock jumped this week from $81 to $86, with calls paying a lot more.

Why? Because AMD has made great inroads in graphic cards and well-priced GPUs. But unlike NVIDIA, AMD has been chosen for MSFT and Sony's consoles, resulting in the likely 39% [predicted growth](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/24/1-big-reason-to-choose-amd-stock-over-nvidia/) in sales in 2020 alone.

That means, likely, the new cycles are going to leave AMD continuing to make significant gains with NVIDIA trailing. Thoughts?

Top Comments:
1. They were chosen for MS and Sony because AMD is willing to come down more in price and accept lower margins than NVIDIA and because AMD is willing to work with them to slightly customize the chips for the consoles.  NVIDIA didn’t want to customize the chips.  Overall NVIDIA still offers the superior product.  We will know more when NVIDIA announces new 3xxx cards or whatever they are called.  I’m still betting NVIDIA will be ahead of AMD.
2. Nvda arm chips could hurt them long run
3. AMD is the 'future', well till the competitors put out better chip than them, and with how unpredictable these things are, it can be in a few years, or maybe a few decades. their p/e is  still ridiculous, which kind of reflect on how strongly pepole believe in the future of AMD
4. Is it not more of a factor of intels delays pushing up the price for amd? News of the amd chips going into the new consoles was out back when amd was still around 50 I think.
5. Not sure if this is the right place but I bought AMD at $13 a share. I think AMD still has runway but I think Intel will eventually get themselves sorted out. Along with what other changes coming down the road in the future.

So my question is should I take profit now? From what I have read long term capital gains are not taxed in 2020 if your AGI is less than 80k.  I fit that description. I would like to sell half of my AMD position and put it in Tesla.

What do you guys think?",26-08-2020 13:54
eh3ce9,investing,"Post: The Future of AMD

Since 2016, AMD has been on an extremely bullish trend. From $1.61/share in 2016, to now $46.18/share today. But just how long can this trend continue before we see a reversal? Will there even be a reversal or pullback going into 2020? Or will 2020 continue this promising upward trend?

**History of AMD share price**

One important limiting factor that AMD has faced two times in the past is the $48.50 level of resistance. AMD has reached this $48.50 all-time high on June 9, 2000. After this all-time high, there has been a downward trend to a lowest price of $3.10/share on October 11, 2002. AMD reversed into an upward trend after this lowest point and reached a similar all-time high of $42.70/share on March 3, 2006. Unfortunately, it got rejected at this level of resistance and bottomed out to a low, low price of $1.62/share on November 21, 2008. After this point, AMD prices never quite skyrocketed like it has in the past. That is, until July 31, 2015, when AMD reversed into a bullish trend once again and reached today's current $46.16/share.

**Is the third time a charm?**

Since this previous low of $1.61/share in 2015, AMD has increased its share price by nearly **2860%**. Going off of previous times in the past, one might expect AMD to fall once again. But is this the case this time? AMD was once thought of as the second-tier in the PC gaming world. In recent years, however, this has changed since AMD has been quite competitive with their CPU products against Intel and GPU products against Nvidia. AMD currently has acquired roughy 1/3rd of both the CPU and GPU marketshare. AMD, since May 1, 2017, has consistently met or exceed its EPS estimates. As of October 29, 2019, AMD had an estimated EPS of 0.18, with the reported EPS meeting 0.18 as well. What's really exciting though, is the big jump of the estimated EPS for January 27, 2020 to 0.31. Will AMD be able to continue its trend of being consistent with meeting or exceeding their estimated EPS?

>\[...\] when we first heard from another source that the high-end ‘Nvidia killer’ GPU (dubbed Navi 23 at the time) [would likely be based on RDNA 2 architecture](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-navi-23-could-be-an-nvidia-killer-graphics-card-that-launches-in-2020). And that this graphics card is expected to debut in mid-2020 – it’s potentially the RX 5900, which could be launched alongside an RX 5800, going by [info recently obtained from Linux drivers](https://www.techradar.com/news/amds-navi-22-and-navi-23-gpus-recently-spotted-in-linux-driver) – so a start of the year reveal would pretty much fit with all this.  
>  
>We’ve also [witnessed leaked roadmaps](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-rdna-2-graphics-cards-may-be-out-in-2020-according-to-leaked-roadmap) showing that RDNA 2 Radeon GPUs are in development, and all this ties in with the possibility of the next-gen consoles possibly getting RDNA 2-powered graphics solutions – remember that those consoles have AMD chips and will support ray tracing, we know that for a fact.  
>  
>And most recently, don’t forget the [RRA certification leak which drove considerable speculation](https://www.techradar.com/news/has-amds-new-high-end-navi-gpu-for-ps5-and-xbox-scarlett-just-been-leaked) about how this could relate to the rumored high-end Navi graphics card, and again this could indicate a launch coming sooner rather than later. Although note that all this should be taken with a considerable degree of caution – but that said, these rumors are starting to seriously mount up now…

**My verdict**

AMD has some important make-it or break-it news for Q1 from a fundamental analysis (earnings, balance sheets, income statements, cash flow, etc.) and qualitative analysis (new products, competition, etc.) standpoint. This new information can help us confirm our belief with the future of AMD. What does /r/investing think about the future of AMD? I look forward to hearing your thoughts and speculations! :-)

1. TA is stupid and third time is always a charm. All in calls!
2. Of they can grap marketshare from Intel AND Nvidia plus the next Gen consoles sell well, AMD can easily rally up to $200 (with an overall bull market to continue)

The stock is still not an earner. Imagine they start to make big profits.
I remember when Amazon or Tesla were rallying without profits and I thought that has to stop. Well profits came and even more ridiculous heights came.

hy3i0a,investing,"Post: AMD vs. Intel: A question of doubt and balance in the marketplace

So the recent stock jump from AMD recently really caught me off guard. As someone who has generally always viewed Intel as a stronger stock to trade on based on a more diversified hold on the market I. E. their technology is integrated in more technologies across a wider range of markets hence my deduction that they tend to perform better in the stock market (historically this seems to be the case). 

However,  I'll admit I've been somewhat removed from viewing the news as much as I normally would due to personal reasons and needing a break from information overload, so my scope on the market was limited at the time,  hence the lapse in my judgement. I'm generally pretty good at reading the market, but this one has really changed my ideas on how I would strategize in the future.

Essentially though, I'd like to ask investors: when you're in doubt, do you go with what you hear the buzz is in the market place, or stick to your guns? Also,  what are your feelings on hedging your bets I. E. splitting your investment up to follow a trend as well as your own predictions and if so,  what is the percentage by which you would generally advocate the ratio of that split? Also,  I feel like we should all probably be using platforms like reddit more often to get a direct view of what investors are doing on the ground floor, kinda like a hub where we can all synchronize our trading watches and therefore help to make more stable bets on the market. However, the issue of false or misinformation always comes to mind - but if moderated correctly, it can really be a godsend (just saying). 

This has become vitally important to me, as the absolutely perfect balance of the Intel vs. AMD difference is so exact that it got me thinking about so many other stocks, information trends and the surreal nature of the stock market. 

You can't always be right and it's difficult to know what to predict these days, but I feel like discussing this is important for investors in general, as any useful answers could really help people save or make a lot of money in the future. 

Thanks!

2. AMD x86 product stacks now totally annihilate Intel, from Server, HEDT, Desktop and to laptop, at lower price point thanks to its low cost chipper strategy. Intel being monolithic meaning they will have little to maneuvour.

AMD had tripled its wafer order to TSMC.

So, the 7nm delay means Intel has no competing products till 2023.

This is how serious it is.
3. If you can ride the trend then ride the trend. No one really can predict the trends. Some make the trend.

2. The short-term downward pressure from Mubadala offloading shares is over. Going forward there are no anticipated and immediate AMD-specific releases or news. As such I'd expect AMD to trade in accordance with the market, multiplied by its beta coefficient, with a tilt to the upside due to their recent product successes.

1. I’ve been buying 50-100 shares of each near $10 and selling if I don’t like the target after it’s announced like SPCE. Pretty much guaranteed a 25-50% gain with very limited downside and an excellent entry into a long term position if it’s a target you’re more bullish on like OpenDoor for me.
2. Had tiny bit of IPOB, sold after Opendoor announcement has had no interest in it (and I don't think that was the kind of company that a lot of IPOB shareholders hoped would come out of it.) Have tiny bit of IPOC, will see what the chosen company is (given the announcement of IPOD, E and F, I'm guessing we find out C company sooner than later) and we'll see how it goes. 

This whole SPAC thing is getting more than a little ridiculous, but I'll play along with a little bit here, a little bit there and there's been a couple of companies that have come out of all this that I find very interesting (Desktop Metal - TRNE) where I have a small position and will see where things go.

So I have stock in INTC and AMD and today has been a weird day and I am trying to work out what happened. So I know if stock goes up and down it affects the NASDAQ index, but somehow it works the otherway around aswell. Intel was at 3-4% green for a long time, but at the end of the day NASDAQ tanked and so did intel and AMD. How does the falling of big companies like FB and AAPL affect the stocks on AMD and INTC.

When they sell off the ‘tech funds’ for example, it’ll drop similar stocks cuz the funds often are compromised of similar holdings.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4367324-amd-is-not-half-intel](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4367324-amd-is-not-half-intel)

**Summary**

When Intel announced the 7nm news, AMD stock gained as much as Intel lost. Investors view Intel’s loss as AMD’s gain.

The market is mistaking. Intel is a data-centric conglomerate. AMD does not compete in most of Intel’s growth opportunities.

The extent of the purported (future) Intel losses is also highly questionable.

AMD is not worth half as much as Intel and seems to have run up mostly on opportunism and dreams.

The second half will provide investors with much additional information (potential catalysts) about both businesses.

3. Seeking Alpha is utter trash. They got burned by being TSLA shorts...
4. It's not. But if Intel is getting important info leaked and also being uncompetitive, the brand has lost a lot of value. 

I don't see Intel having a lot of ways to reverse this downfall in a few years time. AMD on the other hand could do a lot now that their products are solid, brand is rebuilt and has more money to tap into other markets
5. Intel is losing competitive advantage.

Personally I expect big leaps in Visa due to solid volume from JPMorgan and higher credit card balance and in Starbux due to the strong fundamentals outlook.

1. I think GM this am is in the top 5 of the day :P
2. CMG's latest advertising stunt makes it pretty clear that they are going to miss earning. From pure accounting/analytical knowledge; new IFRS provisions require all advertising costs incurred in the period paid - no longer accrued. Therefore their should be a great buying opportunity for a trader who may be looking to hold until Q3 which I expect to exceed or an investor looking to hold long term.
3. I'm in on $SBUX.... they had a new rewards program put in place, the viral ""Pink Drink,"" and various new summer drinks that started. Hopefully this will all lead to a good ER

Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

9eqpyc,investing,"Post: AMD Stock, Overvalued or Fundamentally Sound?

Hey! So I bought a computer about a year ago and of course if I would have bought AMD stock instead of a processor I would have tripled my money. What do you guys think about the whole Intel VS. AMD situation? AMD is up a ton and I'm considering purchasing like $300 worth as my second investment in stocks. I don't really care about the current price, I'd like to hold it for 2-3 years. I'm just curious if it's overvalued and if I should wait for it to go down. Do you even think it could even go higher than $30 in the future? Intel is down to $45ish and I feel like in the near future AMD could be around $45 especially since they're making a new processor faster than the one Intel is working on. 

&#x200B;

Thanks.

1. A couple of things here:

1. Stop comparing share price. It means nothing. Look at things like market cap, EPS, revenue, etc.
2. INTC has many more lines of business currently but that doesn't mean AMD can't disrupt further. I just wouldn't bank on it.
3. u/Project_Zero_Betas is correct about INTC's profits and AMD being a momentum stock, but that doesn't preclude AMD from reaching something like $45. Irrational exuberance and all that. Case in point: TSLA. 

That being said, don't let FOMO take hold. I personally wouldn't buy here. If you really want to buy some AMD, I'd wait and see if it goes down a bit.

3. Fundamentally sound companies tend to add to their book value over time.  AMD has roughly the same book value per share it had in 2009.  It'd be a hard time to convince me that a company who hasn't created shareholder value in almost a decade is undervalued.

1. Would you buy AMD at its current price today?

Don't fall into the sunken cost fallacy. Pretend you have the opportunity to buy AMD at $1.88 **today** (as that is its current price).

Do you buy? If so, keep your money in AMD. If you think AMD will drop below $1.88, then sell.

Its that simple. Don't think about the past, you're far into [sunken costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy), which is an irrational behavior. Man up, ignore the sunk costs and make a rational decision based on market conditions **right now**. Come up with a price target: when do you want to sell AMD?

AMD has hype with Polaris and Zen. But at the same time, its server marketshare has utterly collapsed, and that was its primary source of revenue. We will likely **never** see the AMD of the mid-2000s ever again (when Google was buying $2000 to $4000 AMD Opterons by the thousands. Indeed, [High End Opterons are still AMD's greatest source of margins](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113307) even though they aren't selling anymore). Make your decision based on expectations **today**, not based on what AMD has accomplished in the past.

Measure up AMD as what it is: the GPU maker for Apple, the APU maker for XBox One, PS4, and ""Nintendo NX"". Upcoming Polaris (GPU) and Zen (CPU) projects. Probably first to market with Seattle ARM servers. Bobcat and Jaguar cores are dead. Opteron is dying. Bulldozer is a failure. Jury is still out on Fury and Hawaii GPUs, seems to be at least competitive vs NVidia... the FreeSync strategy seems to be working but the weak margins on these expensive-to-make GPUs is worrisome.

Is AMD worth the $1.5 Billion market cap? That's your decision.
2. You should try waiting till Zen and the new GPUs come out, perhaps that will encourage enthusiasts to buy them. 
3. I did the same exact thing you did.  I am holding for this year and seeing what happens with them.  If by EOY I can't break even at least, I am selling and taking a loss.
4. I don't know whether you should sell AMD or not, but you should at least look into tax loss harvesting if you're determined to sell.
5. Just sell and lock in the losses for later.

1. You're dreaming. You haven't done any sort of analysis whatsoever. If you have, you haven't posted it. Buying solely based on what you said is a terrible idea. 

If you do end up buying, and end up being correct, it's dumb luck and you shouldn't consider doing it again. 
2. You were right about a stock (in a massive bull market) and you think that justifies this new position somehow? Your analysis is non existent. Then you pull $15/share out of your ass. Are you high? Where the fuck does that number come from? You sound like a perfect candidate for an index fund. 
3. I really want AMD to do well... I just have trouble seeing it working haha.

Total PS3 sold in 2 years=80mil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3)

Total XBOX360 sold in 7 years=80 mil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360)

Total pc sales THIS year=285mil (http://www.worldometers.info/computers/)

I also suspect (not based on facts) that AMD will get less profit per chip in the consoles compared with chips in pc.  Consoles WILL be a positive mark for AMD, however they seem to have lost on the latest GPU fight between them and Nvidia, and Intel has such a strong hold on the CPU market that I have trouble seeing them not losing ground there (losing ground due to less pc and laptop sales, more tablet sales which do not use AMD).  The only thing they really have in the pc market is they have better built-in graphics in the CPU, however heavy majority of computers still use Intel even with the built-in graphics.  I do not see either the GPU nor CPU market turning in AMD favor soon.

SEAMIRCO is news to me, might be interesting to see how it pans out.

I have no idea where you got 15/share from...  I can see it hitting maybe $5 or $6 if the consoles turn out well and their new GPU doing better than expected.

[EDIT]

http://techreport.com/news/25527/thanks-to-consoles-amd-posts-first-profit-in-over-a-year  

AMD is expecting between a 2% and 7% increase in revenue in the 4th quarter.
4. You're beyond dreaming, you're delusional. The only way I'd be holding on to AMD stock right now is if I were an AMD employee - odds are still good someone (say, IBM or Oracle, but really they've both got better options; perhaps someone looking for a long term graphics/vector computing play?) might pick up what's left of the company for pennies on the dollar (albeit we've been saying this for at least 3-4 years now, since GlobalFoundries was spun off; may be more realistic now that AMD's completely divested).

In any case, I would never bet far past their current stock price. I think Wells Fargo evaluated them at $6 somewhat recently and I think that's the biggest amount of bologna I'd be even somewhat willing to believe. 

Seeing how much ground they've lost in the server space, their non-existent plan on getting back into cyclical computer purchases (they're essentially dead in the desktop market), and yet-to-congeal plans for the mobile space where ARM and Intel are completely eating their lunches, I would recommend anyone even considering the investment get their collective heads examined. $7.50 is dreaming. $15 is absolutely delusional.
5. PS4 is selling better than expected and I am watching XBOX One closely. I am a technical guy, Master's in EE and worked at AMD's competitor for many years. Their R&D is aggressive and their APU and ARM server roadmap is promising. On a technical basis I am fully behind AMD. 

I must admit that I am woefully ignorant of how this translates in the business world but my sense is that stock analysts really miss on capturing AMDs engineering expertise in their evaluations.

This was great over the summer, but shit is about to hit the fan so to speak because ETH is in the process of shifting from mining based Proof of Work rewards to Proof of Stake (a non-mining based method to reduce the number of coins produced and in circulation), meaning mining will not be worth it in the near future. Already the mining difficulty has increased dramatically meaning it is harder to break even with energy costs... Long story short I would be surprised if AMD can maintain the gain unless it works for non-Ethereum mining.

Unbiased information on how to compound your savings over many years. You can get rich over a long period of time dollar cost averaging into the broad market.

As for investing in individual stocks, statistically, few get wealthy doing so. Many more get slightly above average returns. And most retail investors buying individual stocks underperform the S&P 500, dividends reinvested.

There is a fundamental reason for this. It's hard to identify in advance the long-term winners like AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN, and many others with somewhat shorter runs of success. Even those stocks I named experienced long periods of non-performance since 2000 in which investors bailed. The FAANG stocks meme mutated into the Magnificent 7 in just three short fad-ridden years, so there's no consistency in popular advice. (In the 1960s, the ""Nifty Fifty"" was the meme for blue-chip stocks.) And a very long 20+ year holding period is what it takes to get rich with those stocks.",07-12-2023 20:41

Top Comments:
1. Stock is worth 13B

Semiconductor multiples are 10-15x (so let's assume they should make $1B in income per year, big assumption here)

at 17% margin (intel), AMD should make $5.9B. They currently made $4.3B, so you are looking at $1.6B, AND they must bring the margin from a negative 11.6% to +17%

Now look how much does the Rynzen 5 cost and the vega cost, take that value and divide $1.6B by it. Let's say, out of generosity, we are talking of about $800 = 2 Million people need to buy that. 

If the cost of the sale is lower, then those people go up to 3M. 

The problem is that AMD is nowhere near 17% net profit margin, more likely they are selling $600 piece of equipment for $500. But let's assume they are able to make a profit off that and the profit margin is 5%, then they would need to sell to almost 20M people their rayzen 5 + vega. How likely is that?

Rayzen 5 and Vega won't move the needle.

If the stock goes up or down is just because a couple of people believe it's worth more or less than it is priced in. 

I think you should factor the positive sentiment in the stock and realize that if everyone believes that thing will get better, the downside risk is real and so you should bet on the outcome that gives you the best reward (and not on the most likely outcome).

1. The time to buy was when everyone was panic selling when it went below $10. They just started to turn a profit so you might consider that a buy opportunity. The only problem is the overall market can drag AMD down with it. I personally think it's a great long term play. If you can ride the crazy volatile swings of AMD and not get emotional when it goes down 10% then buy it. Be prepared to average down though.
2. Considering AMD alredy prototyping 7nm chips (to be released in 2019), and Intel having issues with constantly delayed transition into 10nm manufacturing process, I'd say there are good chances for AMD to rise in coming years

Top Comments:
1. It's a pretty low-risk way to remove the decision making from trying to time the market on a stock.

Personally, if I think a company is very well run and positioned for growth, I just buy it right then. The upside of the stock could more than outweigh your premiums gained by selling puts over the same period if the stock doesn't fall below your strike. 

It will also tie up a lot of capital in collateral if you sell a lot of them, especially if you use a reasonable strike price. Selling 10 puts at $45 is going to tie up $45,000 worth of cash all the way until expiration.
2. One negative about your strategy. You sell your puts at 45 strike and the stock deeps below 45 and back up before your puts expire/assignment. You'll miss the opportunity to buy the stock at 45.
3. The wheel is a great strategy.
4. You could sell a put and buy a call for a synthetic position. It's cheaper but has the same risk as buying actual shares (minus the dividends).

Did you see the record low and think the it hit bottom and just bet your gut or did you actually see something?

Please serious remarks if you can stomach it.

1. https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/4qfwd4/rx480_fails_pcie_specification/this is the current drama gong on with AMD since the release of the new card. Expect a drop in price soon if this becomes a legal action.

**TL;DR** The brand new AMD RX 480 does not qualify for PCIe standard specifications because it draws more than 75W directly from the motherboard, possibly without even overclocking. Theoretically, this is a potential fire hazard for people who do not maintain their computers or have poor quality motherboards. In total, it can draw almost 200W, which is not what is being advertised. Apparently, this cannot be fixed with a hardware or software update.

Aside from that, PCIe cannot change their specification because it will invalidate their patents. AMD will have to recall the product if it is proven that it does not meet specification. 

[**This issue has been confirmed by AMD. the scenario where they recall has not.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4qfy9d/i_work_at_amd_the_time_has_come_to_ama_about/d4so3bn?context=9)

Take away this **MAJOR F-UP** and the card is nice. It is comparable to an NVIDIA 970 or AMD R9 Nano. It certainly qualifies as a generational improvement. For the price, it is an excellent deal. However, If NVIDIA drops their prices on older hardware, it's going to remain a toss-up for a lot of people. 

A significant attraction is that it can perform well with Virtual Reality Headsets. That being said, headsets start off at $600... and $800 if you are getting the VIVE, the better of the two current models. It would make sense to make a larger investment and get at least a GTX 1070 ($450) or GTX 1080 ($700) to get optimized functionality.

**Note for Cryptocurrency Duders** AMD has a signifcant share of its market invested in people who mine cryptocurrency, specifically Ethereum (right now). The selling point about this GPU is that they process algorithms quickly (better than NVIDIA) with a small power requirement. In the case of the 480s, every 1 GPU you run,there is an excess wattage being sent through the motherboard. If you own a motherboard with many PCIe slots, and you plan to run many GPUs, you could easily be running an excess of 50W+ through the motherboard. These are potentially a serious hazard right off of the shelves.
2. This is just my opinion.  One reason AMD is so popular here on reddit is because it's a 4-5 dollar stock and people like owning a lot of shares. (even though it doesn't really matter how many shares you own).

If AMD had all of the same news and valuations but it was a 100/share stock, I don't think there would be as much interest on reddit.  Again, my opinion.
3. Bought at 1.85 (probably more luck than anything that I timed the bottom) because I read they had a license (at least partial ownership of the x86 architecture. That and I thought with the upcoming zen and Polaris there would be hype and potential buyout if they thought AMD wouldn't workout but still was worth something. 

After it broke $3 started putting stop loss on it because their Financials are dog shit and they had hyped things before That failed (bulldozer). Ended up getting stopped at $5.10 a healthy return for less than 12 months. (Bought mid sep 2015)

Still have AMD on my watch and wonder if they won't go higher with Mac deal, console deal and zen but they had console deal in previous generation and lost money so I'm hesitant to put too much faith in it. Probably won't get back in just because I try not to chase trends or let my greed blind me, already had my stop loss triggered. 

That being said I'm probably more ignorant in hardware and in financials than a lot of people so maybe it was all dumb luck. Would never put money into stocks like AMD that I couldn't lose and not sleep well at night 

If they start going into the black with their 4xx series then maybe start looking at them again but before that I'm out on the sidelines with my gainz 

Tldr x86 architecture, no other comp to Intel/nvidia, bargain price and upcoming hype thought it was worth the bet 


4. I bought it at about $2.50. Sold it at $4.15. Still kicking myself.
5. Too much risk, I bought NVDA instead because It was virtually a guaranteed gain. I made 20% on a significantly larger investment than I would have risked with a buy of AMD. When you think about it, if you were only going to risk $2000 on AMD and end up making a 100% gain, you went High Risk and made $2000. If you bought NVDA which is super low risk, and put in $20K and made 20% you just made $4000 with significantly lower exposure to risk.

If you Bought AMD at $1.85 you made good money, but you were basically going into the casino and putting it all on red. LoL.",30-06-2016 04:34
1awyoh4,investing,"Post: Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated number

My other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Among the record-setting elements of Nvidia’s NVDA stunning fiscal fourth quarter was its 76% GAAP gross margin, which was up from 66% a year before. Nvidia forecasts that margin will remain around the same level for its ongoing quarter. 

> Nvidia’s gross margins appear to be the second highest in the semiconductor industry, behind only those of Arm Holdings PLC ARM which licenses chip designs but doesn’t sell its own chips directly. Arm’s gross margins were roughly 93% in the December quarter. 

> Nvidia’s margins stand out among those elsewhere in the chip sector. Intel Corp. INTC, reported a gross profit margin of 46% while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, reported a 40% margin in the fourth quarter

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

> In other words, even if Nvidia’s margins come down a bit from here, they’re still poised to sit above those from virtually every peer in the sector.

the problem here is that for nvidia to succeed the companies relying on their tech? they need profit. that's where i can see the comparison to the dotcom bubble re: nvidias valuation. 

&#x200B;

the companies mass buying these GPUs need to over the next few years churn out ai based products that produce billions in profits. my take is that this iteration of ai hype based on LLMs is really just based on a flashy and not actually all that useful piece of tech. i think if we give it another year or two people are going to recognize 'hey, this isnt actually very good at replacing search engines, providing accurate and quality responses to queries on complex topics' etc.
3. The S&P 500 might have a P/E of 22, but forward tech earnings are at 30x. That's rich by most historical standards. Granted the Magnificent Seven throw out free cash flow with no leverage like no one's business, but it's still getting very rich out there. Most other sectors actually haven't seen significant gains.
4. Keep in mind nvidia is an established company heading into the “.AI” bubble…. Amazon was not, along with several others. My point, seems less risk adverse because they are already operating fairly healthy.

y8gt08,investing,"Post: Tesla Q3 earnings call: ""Demand will be harder"" - Elon Musk

First revenue and earnings:

* Q3 Revenue: $21.45 billion versus $22.09 billion expected **so a miss on top line**
* Q3 Adjusted EPS: $1.05 **beat** versus $1.01 expected

More important, during earnings call Elon admitted **""demand will be harder""** referring to the global recession he expects.

Also when asked about **deliveries** he again used the ""in transit"" argument which makes me wonder he already anticipates a Q4 miss.

Musk also said that 50% annual growth will be ""on average"" in other words he probably knows they won't meet that goal this year.

Overall would not be surprised if Tesla in coming weeks and months **will again miss alot of their targets once hard data comes in, esp. demand and delivery number updates.**

Meltdown doesn't affect it so their CPUs look tastier than ever. RYZEN and EPYC sales should be stronger than expected.

A Vega flop is priced in but crypto mining caused both an AMD and Nvidia GPU drought worldwide and strong GPU sales should continue throughout the year.

Crypto miners basically saved AMD from that Vega flop.

They had two exciting hires recently so they're working on something new that includes focusing on power efficiency.

They have a fresh Intel IGP deal with their Vega that was very unexpected as well.

Both AMD and Nvidia should have a strong 2018.

Intel is the weaker one here with their bungled Meltdown patches.

If news comes out next week that the books were cooked and the stock tanks will you feel like a genius?  Absolutely.
2. Nobody went broke taking profits
3. I wouldn't sell the whole position if you still believe in the company.

That's how you miss out in the big ones. 
4. I would only sell if the underlying reasons as to why I bought the stock changed. If it's a company you believe and and have researched it should be profitable over the long term. Selling and trying to ""get back in"" at dips is difficult. Time is very valuable.

I personally don't think you can draw any conclusions about future performance from a chart. When I look at the chart for AMD I see it's spent most of its life as a company at $5 a share or less, if you want to draw conclusions realize the market will have no problem valuing the company at $4 a share if they don't perform.

NYSE = broker market, still (arguably) a bit slow to respond to technological change in the sector, well established and has stringent listing requirements.

Hi all,

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.

Leaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts.

1. Long AMDer here:

I've bought in AMD in 2017 - when it was in low teens. I've been following AMD very closely as I am a PC enthusiast.

AMD has a lot of momentum going for them at this time.

1. They're at parity for single threaded performance vs Intel counter parts; at a much lower price
2. More cores/threads for less money
3. More efficient than Intel processors (This is huge as Intel was super far ahead).
4. EPYC server chips winning contracts/new business everday
5. Outselling Intel CPUs by the mountain load
6. Upcoming consoles PS5, Xbox Series X, Atari VCS all uses AMD chips
7. AMD supplying server GPUs to google (for Stadia)
8. Next generation RND2 GPUs (and big Navi) to be released this year)
9. Ryzen 4xxx to be released this year (with another massive leap in performance)

I could go on but Dr Lisa Su and team has really outdone themselves and they're not stopping anytime soon.

**That being said, there is a certain level of speculation;** the current price is mostly fuelled by their recent product performance/sales (YoY) and that Intel is behind process node (extremely difficult to get ahead once you're behind). Should AMD simply execute their current roadmap for the next 3 years, I foresee a reasonable possibility for AMD to break 10 billion yearly revenue by 2022.

I have slowly reduced my holding in AMD over the last 3 years to avoid over exposure (and to take profit). As of today, I still hold a very sizeable holding in AMD with no plans to reduce my position. I'm sure the stock will go up/down; but at this point I'm in it for the long haul.
2. AMD is grossly overvalued. Grossly.

With a current price earning ratio of 189, and a future (assuming everything goes as optimistically planned) forward price to earnings ratio of 48.78 it's valuation is both sky-high and ridiculous. Which means theoretically, if the business does not grow you will need 189 years to break even on book value or even if it does grow as optimistically expected, you'll still need 48.78 years to break even on book value, not even accounting for inflation.

The intrinsic value of AMD is $1.31, based on normalized Free Cash Flow and Book Value of the company, which is a stark contrast to it's current valuation.

This does not mean that AMD valuation will come back to reality anytime soon, it just means that for AMD to maintain or continue to increase in value, it must a) revenue to not only continue to grow but grow in a exponential speed and b) maintain the speculation hype around it regarding new market opportunities. If AMD falls short on either, there will be blood on the streets.
3. It's always a good time
4. It's hard to tell if partnerships with AMD will benefit their stock. In the past AMD has made most of the processors for gaming consoles and the stock value was still in the teens. There's really no perceivable reason why their price has shot up the last year, nvidia actually has a reason.

Thinking about buying up some shares, what do y'all think?

Top Comments:
1. AMD's roadmap doesn't have any truly exciting products till 2014, when their 64 bit ARM processors are supposed to hit.  Those have the potential to compete with Intel on a price level - they will be *significantly* cheaper than an Intel CPU, and use significantly less power (reducing TCO; something IT departments care about).  It all sounds good on paper, but it remains to be seen if AMD can deliver.

Short term some new Opteron's may cause a bump, and their A series APU's are finally getting attention (after they suffered a massive write down on unsold first gen APU stock), and were in something like 32% of notebook sales last quarter - but with overall computer sales down these days, that's not as interesting as it may have been a few years ago.

I think they're more or less stabilized where they're at.  One thing to watch out for in the short term are their Q1 results - they've predicted that their restructuring should be mostly complete by then, and that they should start seeing a savings in their operating costs.  If they fail to hit those marks, and continue to hemorrhage money, I can see the stock dipping to November levels, if not worse.

If you're buying AMD, expect to hold on to it till 2014, unless you can get lucky and sell during one of the brief spikes they're going to have this year.

I have a very small amount of money in AMD, and I'm planning to sit on it for quite some time.
2. I'll level with you, I have no idea why it has run up so high already. 

I bought in at $2.06 and am fully prepared to see $1.50 this year before we see $5 or more (most likely in 2014).

People are saying that AMD has no future, I beg to disagree. You are looking at a company that has been fighting INTC for almost 40 years. 

Intel has shown no inclination to go for the killing blow to AMD. Just look at what they are doing with Haswell and Ivy Bridge Based 8 core Xeons and E series(all pushed back). Intel has a huge lead but are not driving the stake in AMDs heart because Intel has to make the money themselves and they really do not worry about AMD any more.

As long as AMD can get their debt obligations in check, they have a pretty decent future both in x86, GPUs and possibly ARMs in micro servers. 

Second problem for AMD are their obligations to GloFo, they are actually paying a penalty to GloFo so they do not have to buy as many chips from them. Kind of sucks, but that's what happens when Mubadala owns 100% of GloFo and 19% of AMD.

Also, they seem to have managed a way to work with both TSMC and GloFo. That is a good thing for a fabless firm.

Remember, Intel has 100B cap and AMD less than 2B. AMDs CPU market share is not 1:50 of Intel, it is more like  1:5 , it is just that AMD needs to get their expenses under control. There is much more upside to AMD stock than INTC if things go well.

To my granny I would tell buy INTC, for those who want something with more potential I would recommend AMD (under $3.50 at least)
3. By divesting itself of its manufacturing operations it will be impossible to compete with Intel on price or performance.  By price I mean $/MIP and MIP/Watt not sticker price.  The tight integration of manufacturing and engineering they once had (and that Intel maintains) is gone.  

They did that out of necessity to stay alive so I won't fault management - but to think they will ever relive their Athlon days of beating Intel is wishful thinking.  It is no longer the same company.
4. You really shouldn't invest in companies that have no future. Buying AMD is trying to catch a falling knife.  Their future is almost certainly languishing at the bottom of the barrel, then being acquired and the assets sold off.

There may be a pop in AMD's stock when they get acquired, too, and there's a very small chance that the next series of consoles - several of which are using AMD graphics cards - might move the stock, or that their ARM processors will be a big hit. But, they currently have no competitive advantage in a hugely competitive market, they have no cash in a hugely expensive R&D world, and their boardroom is a mess.

The S&P500 is up 14% this year, and flat over 3 months; AMD is down 19.5% in the last 3 months, and 52% on the year. Their Q3 return on equity is negative 60%, return on assets is -18%. Yearly profits are flat; quarterly, they're down 12%. Among analysts, 22 buys, 99 holds, 19 sell ratings - 90 days ago that was 61 sell ratings to only 15 buy ratings. EBITDA was at -5%. Intel is worth over $105 Billion; AMD is worth less than $2 billion.

AMD is on borrowed time.

oq67l,investing,"Post: Had AMD for a few months, how long do I hold it for?

While everyone else was jumping ship I have had AMD for the past few months, got it at $5.83 and just held it through all the slides and now it's at $6.42. How long do I keep holding it for?

Top Comments:
1. The ultimate question to ask yourself is:

Would you buy it if it were at $6.42?

If yes, hold.
If no, sell.

Sorry I can't be of any more insight than that, I'm no specialist in $AMD.
2. double down with maximum leverage!
3. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

But more seriously - keep it until they announce earnings, it might hit $6.80 or so, which is when you will want to sell.
4. ""How long do I hold it for?""

You should have known the answer to that question before you bought it.  Trading is like flying on an airplane.  Always know where your exits are.  
5. It looks like it just broke through some resistance at 6.  Look for it to test that level.

I would put in a stop order in around or just below $6.  If the stock drops it will automatically get you out so you don't need to guess at ""when should I get out""... you should already know when you want out.  If it keeps going up, ride it up and move the stop up with it to lock in those gains.

Notice the earnings call on the 24th... There is a good chance that will be a volatile day.  If you want to be safe, get out now, take your profits, and then see what happens at earnings and act accordingly.  If you want to gamble, you can stay in.  You could see it go up a few points in 1 day.  You could see it go down a few points in one day.  Or it might not do much at all.  I tend to like to avoid the stress of earnings on stocks.  They can pay off, but it's a 50/50 shot and things always tend to go down more than they go up, so I don't like to take the risk.  Everyone's risk tolerance is different though.  If you have a lot of it, maybe you just sell half of the position, that's an option as well.",21-01-2012 13:09
i9av7q,investing,"Post: AMD CEO sold $15.9 millions worth of AMD stock

According to the SEC filing, here are a couple of high-profile AMD insider selling for the past couple days:

1. Lisa Su (CEO): sold $11.8M worth of AMD stock in Aug 11, and sold $4.1M in Aug 9.
2. KUMAR DEVINDER (CFO): sold $5M in Aug 11, and sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
3. Bergman Rick (EVP): $1.9M in Aug 9.
4. Papermaster Mark D (CTO): sold $1.25M in Aug 9.
5. GRASBY PAUL DARREN (SVP & CSO): sold $1.2M in Aug 9.
6. Norrod Forrest Eugene (SVP): $934k in Aug 9
7. WOLIN HARRY A (SVP): sold $698k in Aug 9.
8. SMITH DARLA M (CAO): sold $332k in Aug 9.

That is a total of $28.4M in 2 days, which is a lot of profit-taking for a short amount of time.

Will this trend continue as AMD price keeps hitting ATH? Quite possible. This means that more volatility is coming for AMD, which we have already seen recently with all these crazy swings. So don't YOLO/FOMO into AMD because of all the hype.

This could be rumors, but the writing has been on the wall for quite a while. This doesn't look too good for Intel but then again Intel has been struggling for quite some time. Does anyone think Intel may try to make a stronger push toward the datacenter market as it starts to cede in the PC chip area? Or do you think Intel's PC customers are not very likely to follow Apple's footsteps either?

Top Comments:
1. So I assume this means even higher profit margins for Apple right ?
2. I’m probably way off, but wouldn’t it kill the bootcamp functionality and windows virtual machines in Mac OS? I think I had read around that it was made possible when Apple switches to Intel Chips.
3. Absolutely Intel has already announced plans to create a GPU line targeting data centers. Will it work? It’ll be tough for them to dethrone NVDA, the main battle will be against AMD, who’s 2021 target date, data center GPU seems like an absolute monster in the making. Better performance and lower wattage consumption ie less heat. The real winner of all of this is TSM.
4. On pure performance Intel held over a decade where there was no competition.

Today there is AMD’s new Ryzen architecture which gives Intel a very good run for the money.  This chip is x86 compatible and can run software for Intel CPUs.  For simplicity let’s call this “speaking English”.

And then we have ARM, which Apple and Qualcomm are the largest firms producing those chips.  For our simplistic explication let’s say they speak Spanish.

Software for x86 (English) won’t work as is on ARM (Spanish) even if developed against the same operating system.  So it either needs to be recompiled (rewritten in Spanish) or needs to be on the fly translated (which is really slow).

Apple has twice now switched CPU architectures that are incompatible with one another and this move to ARM will be switch #3.  It takes a lot of effort to pull off such a major switch and not anger or confuse users in the process.

Once Apple moves to ARM the only real big use left for Intel is Windows PCs and the data center.  Windows 10 was ported to ARM as well and AMD has a very competitive chip for the data center.

I don’t see Intel having much relevance a few years from now.

In the competition with NVDA and INTC, they are handicapped by having less money for R&D. AMD struggles to stay close behind NVDA and while it's done a bit better lately competing against INTC, they still are unable to compete and generate margins that make them much, if any, money.

EDIT: Voting is closed. I took screen shots and will post the selected stocks here tomorrow morning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, 

I have a tonne of time to kill this week and was looking to occupy it with some stocks to value. 

Rather than do it just for me, I thought I would value stocks that /r/investing wanted. 

**The proposal:**

- Post the company you would like valued. Others vote it up or down. 
- The 10 companies that have the most votes by end of day Monday (11:59pm EST on August 3, 2015) are the ones I will value.
- I'll post the results of each valuation in a separate thread by the end of this week for everyone to judge.

**Rules:**

- No penny stocks
- No pre-revenue companies 
- Less popular is better. I'm not sure what value I can add by being the 10 millionth person to value Apple or Tesla or IBM. Go beyond the ""big boys"". It'll be more interesting that way. [READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo1ov) & [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo82v)
- No Resource stocks. They are reliant on commodity prices and that is something I don't feel comfortable projecting out into the future. But I can take a pass at it if people want

**My Promise:**

- Complete Objectivity. I will use only that which I can objectively justify with data as far as possible
- Full transparency. I'll post all my assumptions, thought processes and sources and I'll be around to answer any questions
- A Comfort Rating. I'll rate each valuation from 1 to 5 to illustrate how comfortable I am with the numbers that went into it. For example, a valuation of ConEd would get 4 or 5 because it is easy to know most things about that company great accuracy. it's revenues and margins are regulated and not much is going to change about its market

Hope this is something people are interested in. 


EDIT: grammar, many missing words and a re-wording to make things succinct

I’m familiar with the tech industry and am quite confident that AMD has been oversold. Their new product line ryzen has been eating away at intel, and ryzen+ debuts this week. Preliminary benchmarks indicate a 10%+ increase in IPC due to architectural tweaks and that’s without looking at clockspeed bumps. Several OEMs have decided to use ryzen for their laptop rollouts over intel and general enthusiasm across consumers is heavily pointing towards ryzen+, with 7nm ryzen 2 (50% die shrink) set for 2019.

Buy and hold AMD long, while it’s still cheap at $10! This is not the same amd of years past.

1. So judging from your post history, a month ago you were a new investor looking for help on how to invest 130k and a month later you're pumping AMD. Sounds like solid intel (*pun intended*).

3. This is the constant meme bullshit ""analysis"" that techno neckbeards constantly use WRT AMD.

Just dig through a few 10Ks.

AMD would have been gone long ago (shortly after the Opteron bubble burst) if they had not been able to support a cash flow negative business by selling assets and debt.

You've got all this crap in this thread about Intel scrambling to keep up with AMD tech., etc.  Meanwhile, if you *actually look at the business*, Intel is still going gangbusters and AMD will be right back to shitsville if there is even the slightest hiccup.

> It’s clear to any hardware enthusiast that amd is on the trend upwards and is stealing market share from intel.

Zzz.  Someone asks you to provide some financial insight as to why AMD is going to outperform in the (near) future, and this is your response?  This is qualitative, not quantitative.

> I think that we as the consumers, especially ones in the industry with knowledge, are best poised to capitalize on huge returns. We understand the product, the nature of the competition, the overall excitement for said product, ease of use, costs, etc.

But, you don't understand anything about the business.

And AMD has to *stay* substantially profitable just to get out from under all the debt coming due in the next few years.

>  This is not the same amd of years past.

The 30 year chart is a real thing of beauty.

I made a lot of money on AMD during the Opteron years.  I've made even more in Intel during all the other years.  I have a 6 core Ryzen in my desktop.  But, AMD is seriously overvalued at $10, and was way overvalued at $15 given their financial situation.

ef6s79,investing,"Post: Your thoughts on AMD shares?

I have sime AMD shares since 18 months and the make a good plus. What you think about them?

Top Comments:
1. The main bull thesis here is that AMD takes a significant market share from Intel, right? So lets compare them. We should consider Intel to be the ""upper bound"" of an investment in AMD. Theoretically if AMD and Intel swap places, that is.

AMD has a PE of 244, market cap 54B and revenue 6.5B

Intel has a PE of 14, market cap 260B and revenue of 71B. 

You can see the market is pricing in SIGNIFICANT growth already for AMD. The earnings would have to double FOUR times to reach a ""fair value"" multiple of PE \~15 like Intel roughly has. That is to say, the market is ALREADY pricing in a x16 increase in earnings.

So from a risk perspective, investing further into AMD at this point has the obvious risk that they can't live up to this. Assuming the gains will mostly come from stealing market share from Intel, you have to believe that:

\- AMD can x16 earnings when they only have room to x10 their revenues to reach Intel's level. This can happen if they increase their margins which should happen through economy of scale

\- AMD can x16 earnings by x16 their market share. Right now that is going from 5% to 80% market share

These two are within the limits of reason. However if you invest now expecting a x2 in stock price you are getting into some weird places. Can AMD reasonably grab 160% market share? Probably not, I don't think this is a segment that will have 60% YoY growth just because AMD is the bomb. 

So here we are really seeing a picture where the AMD price is nearing the ""upper bound"" already. And keep in mind they have a strong trajectory but they are still only 5% of the market. Do you not think Intel will fight back? Every generation the favored player changes.

I see a ton of risk here at the current PE multiple and AMD not living up to expectations. In the short term the euphoria may continue higher but it's easy to imagine a catalyst that could disrupt the whole run. For example, Intel coming out with a better product. Or AMD's numbers stagnating for a quarter or two and raising doubt about the growth story. It's not a question of whether AMD will grow, its a question of how much and will it live up to the expectations already priced in.

So for me, I wouldn't be a buyer at this price, even though the company itself has a bright future it seems.
2. Interested more in TSM to be honest.
3. One real competitor for the next 3 years on the x86 server side. Intel. 
Intel has massive issues in their fab and core creation side. Likely 2023 launch date for their next game changing architecture.

AMD is working with TSMC who is crushing it with 7nm+ fabs and is on track for 6nm,5nm and even 3nm fabs. Well ahead of intel and Samsung at this point. AMD also has the core lead till at least 2023.  

So - I’m a mega bull on AMD and TSM until 2023 and will re-evaluate then.   I can’t see any world where AMD doesn’t hit 60 by the end of 2021.

All that saving is moot if you’ve got 25k sitting on a credit card at like 15-20% interest that you’re making minimum or no payments on.

1. It goes beyond the crypto hype. Their CPUs are, for the first time in years, truly competitive with Intel, and many of their offerings have a significant performance per dollar edge over Intel counterparts. Their Threadripper HEDT processor prompted Intel to offer an extremely rushed and clumsy response with their x299 platform, which garnered significant backlash in the tech community. There are a number of videos detailing the many wrongheaded aspects of the x299 launch, with the central point being extremely poor value when compared to its AMD counterpart.

While the HEDT market doesn't amount to much in the grand scheme of things, it could be a bellweather of things to come.

The real question IMO is whether or not Ryzen will break into the mobile market in a big way. If AMD can provide competitive chips for laptops while undercutting Intel's prices, I wouldn't be surprised to see manufacturers start offering a lot more AMD powered machines.
2. Check out r/amd or r/amd_stock
3. The fact that they were able to push out their loans from 2018 to 2022 is a big fucking deal IMO. It means they have a chance at actually paying those loans off.
4. You're not missing much, people are just speculating a lot on how successful/profitable their new processors will be.  A lot of the long thesis have an underlying assumption that AMD is going to be able to undercut Intel price wise and still be very profitable in the process which historically hasn't been the case and they also lack their ownership of their own foundries at this point.

Management has improved the product line by a lot and taken advantange of the run up in stock price to vastly improve their balance sheet and the company is undoubtedly worth more than it was in early 2016 but a lot of the stock price isn't underpinned by fundamentals at this point.  Once Q3 and Q4 data start coming in profitability should be clearer, but guidance hasn't been particularly aggressive for 2017 at this point.
5. People will start taking profits once the company makes actual money and the valuation won't be based on expectations and predictions of future cash flows. Think about Tesla or Amazon.",15-06-2017 01:05

Looking at the financials the company hasn't turned a profit in years, earnings are negative, they're selling way above book value, probably will have negative cash flows in coming years, and theres the questionable future of the Ryzen technology. How the fuck is this shit still $13? Is it just hype and ridiculous expectations for the future? If not for their cash I feel like this company would go to 0 before going up anymore.

Top Comments:
1. I have to say I'm flabbergasted at the level of stupidity in this thread. Ryzen is extremely successful, the R7s invalidate the expensive i7s in productivity, the R5s invalidate the i5s in many cases, TDP is lower in both cases.
I've actually been logging people's purchases in my country's partpicker, people now choose AMD CPUs about 70% as much as Intel CPUS. (before Ryzen it was about 10%).
The RX 480 wins over the 1060.
Intel is extremely mismanaged right now (oh BTW, it's only a little $170B company).
Not to mention AMD is actually going to license GPU tech to Intel. And they have a ton of IP.
Not even talking about the server market here, or many other positives for AMD.

People were saying it was ridiculously expensive at $4, when the stock had gained 50% in one day.

2. Because this is the first time in years they have a lineup of marketable products, executable management, and Naples on the horizon which should take market share away from INTC and NVIDIA. 

Made in China is definitely not a bad thing - see Alibaba or any t-shirt in Walmart
3. Tesla is a 50B market cap company and they are losing twice as much money as AMD. In 2015 they even had the same revenue and Tesla still had a much higer loss. 

Im not comparing the two companies. Just making a point that stock valuation is tricky and share price is often years ahead of fundamentals.

bxqty9,investing,"Post: AMD rally - INTC bulls what's your prospects on the future?

Genuinely interested in the INTC bulls perspective given AMD recent rally which is highly justified by a release of new great products. Is INTC the new IBM?

Top Comments:
1. The new IBM? I don't think so. They're one of two players in the field, sans SoC/ARM developers. Their R&D budget and valuation are significantly more attractive than AMD's from an objective standpoint. At the end of the day, do I expect them to be around 20 years from now? Yes. Do I think AMD putting them in their place was a good thing? Yes. Last time that happened, we got the Core 2 Duo. Cyclical demand could hold them down for a bit, but that would impact AMD as well. If I'm looking long-term, they seem rather attractive, but I'm not here to push the stock. I just find it amusing how doom and gloom people get during a single news cycle.
2. AMD is a good company at a bad price. Its trading at 110x PE, while NVidia are in the 25x PE area, and Intel is 10x PE.

Is AMD going to be growing in the coming years? Of course. Are they going to be growing 4x faster than NVidia or 10x faster than Intel? I don't think so.

I love AMD's products, but they've entered a hype cycle. Their stock is overvalued.
3. I know someone personally who believes Intel would eventually launch 10nm desktop chips. They saw the 2017 dual-core, no IGP 10nm CPU as just a temporary setback.

As for me, I'm concerned that there will be more security bug releases for Skylake down the road. They don't impact Intel 's finances directly right now, but if a major customer files a lawsuit, it could snowball quickly into multiple class action lawsuits with law firms seeing it as an opportunity.

I can't imagine how much cloud providers and other major server farms are shelling out to buy more hardware due to the amount of performance hits, especially with the recommendation to disable HyperThreading, which is essential for most highly threaded tasks.
4. Ryzen baby
5. AMD is really only competing in desktop and some in the server market. they're doing well but their market share is still quite down, I don't think Intel has huge amount of worry about especially with 10 man of me or chips rolling out this year.

2. >Amd thoughts

I think the company doesn't realize that if you're going to issue equity to finance projects, you should expect a higher return on that invested capital than the cost of the equity.  The shareholder dilution at this company is just crazy, and the stock has to appreciate somewhere between 3.5% and 5.5% just to break even.

Case in point - if you had invested on Dec. 29th, 2015 at the closing price of $3.00, and held until Dec. 27th, 2016, and sold at the closing price of $12.07, you would have recorded a stunningly large **313.36%** gain.  The value of the company, though, as measured by market cap, rose from $2.37 Billion to $11.19 Billion over that same time frame, **372.15%** gain.

It's easy to be dismissive when you've gained so much, but if the company faces more difficult times, and keeps issuing shares like they're candy - which they are - don't be disappointed when your returns are much worse than the underlying fundamentals.

4. Sorry others are being rude cause you're not talking about etf's. AMD is undoubtedly going to rise. They have had a good turn of fortune recently with Intel botching their cpu's and AAPL using AMD hardware. Also as you said, Xbox will bring more revenue. Think things can go well in the near to mid term with AMD. Low 11's could be a solid entry point.

1. AMD is doing everything right in processor and graphics technology right now (and the last 2 years). They also have a roadmap and for the last few years they have been on that roadmap with no misses. Take it from a compsci engineering student. (Almost fully invested in AMD for the past 4 years.
2. So, how leveraged *are* you on that short?

AMD is the swarm of mosquitos that keeps coming back every few months to suck a few drops of blood from Intel and NVidia, forcing them to keep moving.  And every few years it somehow manages to suck enough to really make them stumble for a while.
3. You don't understand the AMD special sauce in technology advantage 😉. They are going to gain more market shares as Intel still stuck on 14nm+++++
4. It's their latest chip architecture that's allowing them to take some of Intel's massive market. Mostly the promise of future sales as server farms get upgraded, more of their chips end up in consumer products, etc.

I definitely wouldn't call them a POS company--they've been in the game a long time and at one point in their history were giving Intel a good run for their money. This seems to be happening again.

I don't hold AMD and was considering buying at $10 when their new architecture was just released and definitely regret it now.

kt1o6m,investing,"Post: AMD and Pricing the XLNX Acquisition

Conclusions: 

1) Current fair market price for AMD, if we fold in XLNX's outstanding shares worth $35bn, is $101.14/share.   
2) AMD will be trading at no less than $150/share by spring 2023, representing 24% gain per year for 2.5 years. (Personally I'm putting it at $175, or 31.6%/yr for 30 months.)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key assumptions that are by no means a done deal: 

1. They will complete the deal as planned by the end of 2021, meaning they will meet unspecified pre-conditions and receive regulator approval
2. The all-stock purchase will be completed for the stated price of $35 billion. 

If those assumptions hold true, then the following is also true: 

The current fair market value for AMD stock, if XLNX's current market cap and outstanding shares are folded into the mix, is $100.96/share, based on the 7 Jan closing price, or $101.14 based on the year-end $35 billion purchase price. The latter represents a 6.33% increase over the 7 January 2021 AMD closing price of $95.16/share. This is only based on up-to-date market cap figures and most-recent-quarter earnings figures, which are a good three months out of date at this point. 

Additionally, in the press releases and earnings calls where the CEOs discussed the merger, one of the points that came out was that the companies have a lot of overlap when it comes to their business operations and R&D. Within 18 months of the merger, or late spring 2023, that means they will be able to [cut $300 million in annual expenses](https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/components-peripherals/the-35b-amd-xilinx-acquisition-7-big-things-to-know/2), simply through synergy of eliminating functional overlap. Given the following from the most recent quarterly reports, covering 3 months of operations ending 26 Sep 2020: 

1. XLNX net earnings were $193.8m, or $775.2m annualized
2. AMD net earnings were $390m, or $1.56b annualized
3. Combined earnings are $2.33b

That means that net earnings will be increased by 13%, just in cutting overlapping expenses. That means that, assuming today's earnings and today's share prices, and combining the financials of both companies, the fair market value for AMD as of early- to mid-2023 is $114, based on annualized earnings numbers that are already three months old. 

Using conservative extrapolation of recent growth trajectories, and using today's price multiples\*, it's conservative to estimate that AMD will be trading for $150/share by June 2023. Based on the current share price of 95.12, that's an annualized growth of 23.96%. 

\*If for whatever reason there's a market downturn in this time, AMD's performance could live up to these numbers, but the price multiples could decrease. This represents nearly all remaining risk of inaccuracy, outside the stated assumptions.

Please fire away at this. Poke your holes and make your arguments. I'm getting ready to heavily shift my portfolio's center of gravity into AMD based on all this, so if any of you know a good reason not to, I'd love to hear it.

2. Thanks for this! I’ve been concerned about the recent slowdown and needed to do this analysis myself but hadn’t gotten around to it.
3. I think your analysis of the fundamentals makes a lot of sense and I agree with the conclusion! Looking at the short term, this stock has managed to avoid drawing too much hype in 2020 despite having some extremely cool stuff in the pipeline. If they manage to roll out a plan towards competitive ARM and 5nm chips in sufficient volume I think this stock would experience some absolutely massive valuation expansion.

But honestly, the reason I'm considering buying this company is because the market literally can't get enough processors. All AMD needs to do to massively increase sales is pump out as many processors as they can and the market will eat it up. That's a hell of a position to be in when the market is being saturated with ridiculous companies worth similar valuations with garbage sales and non-existent moats. It's a more aggressive ""Microsoft-style"" play where it's the future but it's proven it can actually execute, I like that a lot.

There's a lot of short-term catalysts too between CES on the 12th and earnings near the end of the month. I think I'll buy 200 shares on margin next Monday and sell some Jan 29 \~110 calls against it as a safety.

1. I didn't see the article discussed in this thread but it should be noted that AMD is not the same company it was in '06.

In '06 they were not producing a quality product, and were trying to compete (poorly) with Intel. It wasn't until they slimmed down their product line and decided to do a few things really well that they got their reputation back. The product line is expanding again, but only when they know they have the capacity to excel at something.

They've gotten their chipsets into servers, an area that was **dominated** by Intel. 

They are slowly but surely eating at the market share by making a quality product at a super reasonable price. From gaming to healthcare.

2. There are 4 key distinctions between 2003 and today that make it much harder for Intel to leapfrog.

Athlon 64 wasn't a completely scalable design the way Zen is.
TSMC fabs outclass Intel.
Intel doesn't have the right patents for the future computing needs and have been trying to square peg round hole (knights landing) their way into HPC space. 
(speculative) Intel is a bureaucratic nightmare (Jim Keller departure without a launch)
3. This time will be different because Lisa Su isnt a suit and Intel can't cheat as much as they use to.
4. AMD has been kicking Intel's ass ever since they released their Ryzen platform in 2017. Intel has literally been playing catch up to AMD since and even then AMD beats Intel with every new product launch. The only place where Intel still had the edge was in gaming performance due to its better iops but that edge too is now getting chipped away as the latest Ryzen 3900 processors are beating (or at least matching) Intel at gaming performance too.

Intel is catching up slowly as its going to move to the 7nm archetecture with its next generation of processors while AMD has mentioned they're not going to mvoe to 4nm for at least another generation, we are afterall reaching the physical limits of silicon diode miniaturisation here...

Anyway AMD has been chipping away at Intel's lead in the CPU market share since 2017 and every year it is taking larger chunks of the market share as now many consumer laptops and desktops are switching to Ryzen CPUs too and its no longer just the highend desktop enthusiasts. Even a lot of data centers and servers are switching to AMD along with office computers. AMD is no longer the budget option, it has become the superior (if not just as good) choice.

3. To put it mildly, 2012 was a rough year: AMD lost over $1 billion, effectively wiping out its $471 million profit in 2010 and its $491 million profit in 2011—its two most profitable years in the last decade. Over the last 15 years, AMD has sustained a net loss of nearly $7 billion, and the company has been downgraded by credit rating agencies, burned by lower demand for PCs (and hence, for its products), and even called ""un-investable"" by one Wall Street analyst.
4. I think it will crest $6, maybe even $7, for a brief moment before falling back down to the $3.20 range as people shed the stock they've been holding since it was around $3.00.  It's happened numerous times before, and while AMD isn't bleeding out debt as badly as it has been, it still has a huge debt hole to climb out of before investors truly feel warm and fuzzy about it.  I don't think the company is going anywhere, but it won't stay at $6.00 very long once it gets there.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-slides-as-revenue-forecast-comes-in-light-2019-07-30?mod=hp_investing

AMD said expects adjusted third revenue of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, while analysts had forecast on revenue of $1.94 billion.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $ 35 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with $116 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 8 cents a share.

Revenue declined to $1.53 billion from $1.76 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $1.52 billion.

1. This is not a sharp decline for $AMD. You could call it a healthy pull back. The stock has seen a lot of gain last week.
2. it's down 3% after a crazy run... what are you talking about?
3. Announced specs of some new products yesterday at E3. Seems like the general consensus is that the reveals didn't meet expectations.
4. AMD moves regularly 2-5%.  It bounced off ATH.  If you believe in technicals then this is normal behavior while hitting a strong resistance, which seems to be about 34.
5. Maybe you give merit to TA, maybe you don't... Look at the 52wk high and notice how this past rally stopped exactly at that level (about $34.30). This is exactly where I would expect a slight pullback to happen.

Also, people tend to buy the rumor and sell the news. The news came, and even though it was pretty good, it was just time to sell the news. There will be more hype/rumors in the near future and I expect more gains from this stock. Don't worry about this pullback, it may retrace to 28/29.

3. There are plenty of reasons to invest in Intel however short term gains is not it. It's possible that  they will be range bound for months between say 45-55 even if you think long-term they will do good. But that said here are my thoughts:

**Macroeconomic Trends**

The stock market is nuts right now, AMD/Nvida ARE eating Intel's lunch but at the same time intel is immensely more profitable than both companies COMBINED. The valuations for both AMD/Nvidia assume they will grow immensely over the next decade and basically ""can't"" Mess up. Nvidia needs to be the undisputed king of GPU and AMD needs to basically eat half of Intel's market share just for TODAY's price to make sense. How do they grow from here? This is true of much the market, Zoom, Tesla, etc... There's a potential pop or at least stagnation coming for trendy companies. Short term it's hard to predict when the gravy train will end. But Intel has much less downside from these numbers than many companies (including Nvidia/AMD)

**The Recent Drop**

Intel's government and datacenter sales dropped 37% this quarter. This is FOLLOWING 30% increases for two quarters. What likely happened is as covid hit governments and enterprises massively bought up new servers to service the WFH world and now that covid is unwinding combined with a really rough economic environment (unemployment, slowing of economy, etc...) those entities are ""good"" with their current server capacity since their recent upgrades. For the year these sales are still up.

It's important to note these numbers do NOT include cloud sales. Cloud sales were up 15% this quarter. Is 15% good? I don't actually know because if the market grew by say 50% it's possible intel got 15% and AMD got the rest. That said Intel's PE ratio is so low this is fine, and AMD's is so high that this MUST be true. Also a cloud CPU is likely more efficient than an enterprise one as many players share it in VMs and such. Meaning if every single government/enterprise datacenter moved to the cloud it's very likely Intel would sell less CPUs is overall demand stayed static.

All in all this is to say the recent drop seems a bit of an overreaction, it's not great news but also not terrible and unpredicted.

**Manufacturing Woes**

This is the big one. Constant delays of 10nm, 7nm. Currently 10nm is subpar in yields. That said their newest fab just came online allowing them to sell more 10nm. Next year they will be releasing their first desktop 10nm CPU (after one final hurrah of 14nm...). This means Intel is very behind TSMC on manufacturing capabilities. That said until this latest AMD CPU Intel wasn't actually that far behind for many applications. It was the single core king, and may still be for non consumer, but we don't know yet. This means despite AMD having all of TSMC's manufacturing prowess it's unable to significantly pull ahead of Intel. We're not talking an order of magnitude, AMD is better by a manageable percent. This means when intel figures it out and gets their act together their CPU designs will very likely be able to beat AMD's. 

Next is the possibility of abandoning their fabs to use TSMC - Intel could strike a deal to kill their 7nm process. This would likely be PAINFUL for the short term on Intel's books (stock price may like it, not sure) as they have to take a massive writedown of lost invesment. But it is an option. It's not like AMD is beating Intel in manufacturing, TSMC is. TSMC would jump at a deal that causes Intel to abandon next gen fabs as long as the contract was air tight and Intel can't just just TSMC short term and abandon them once Intel catches up. 

**Actual CPU Tech**

It's interesting how far Intel has been able to push 14nm. If their next CPU in march can take back the crown for single core king it means that we have a 14nm CPU versus a 7nm CPU beating single core. Even if it doesn't it's still interesting they can be so close.

What this highlights is Intel's manufacturing problems, not a base CPU design problem. If Intel solves its 7nm problem, and their 14nm can at least be competitive in some cases. Then AMD should actually worry a little bit that they only have a few years window where they're on top. If Intel had been using TSMC all along they'd be on top for sure right now (though much lower margins).

Also Intel's behind not due to dragging its feet but rather for trying a VERY risky method of getting to 10nm and 7nm that is way better than TSMC's. However everyone said it couldn't be done and... well... maybe they were right.  Intel likely was overconfident and took too large a risk. Everyone is calling them a dinosaur and not investing and not innovating. But the reality is sometimes innovation is risky, and Intel took a risk and lost. That's NOT good for a company but it's not an indication of lack of innovation.

For everyone that thinks Intel can't innovate just remember one thing: Intel **invented** the process TSMC uses, just that they decided to use something else. Intel actually owns the patents and IP for AMD's x86 CPU design AND TSMC's manufacturing process. That doesn't sound like a lack of innovation to me, just sounds like terrible execution.

**Future Investment and Bright spots**

Intel's not just all CPU either and that's key. Intel will be releasing their first standalone GPU very soon and it's rumored to be extremely efficient (aka good for laptops). Later next year their will release their first gaming GPU that's targeted to be better than a 3070, and while I'd take it with a grain of salt that it actually will be better it's still very interesting. Also these GPUs will be 6nm courtesy of TSMC. There's no way it doesn't take a few years for Intel's GPUs to catch up but there's an opportunity to open an extremely large new line of revenue here and compete more directly with Nvidia. I think it's very likely Intel will be able to beat Radeon on GPUs but Nvidia is a bit harder to match.

Mobileye by itself would likely be one of those 500PE companies that everyone is nutting over on wallstreetbets. But it's part of Intel so few really care about it. They have some of the best automating driving tech  in the world and will be what NIO uses. Also Tesla used to use them and basically took all their ideas and in housed it. Tesla did not actually have all the best answers for automated driving, Mobileye did and they copied it. Mobileye is very possible a huge win by itself.

R&D as a whole, Intel spends more on R&D than all of AMD's revenue. The next big breakthroughs, just like the last big breakthroughs will happen because of Intel. Whether Intel takes advantage is another issue but they have massive investments in far out there R&D. 

**TL;DR;**

It's cops vs robbers. NVIDIA/AMD need to execute perfectly going forward to justify their prices. Intel only needs a single win. If Intel gets a GPU out that can match Nvidia? Win. Intel fixes their manufacturing? Win. Mobileye explodes in growth? Win.

All the above is only a bull case because of relative valuations. I do believe as time goes on AMD will grow and take market share from Intel. That's a given. But what's not a given is that both AMD and Intel can't grow going into the future. Intel's prices so low it doesn't need to actually keep market share, just be able to expand into a larger market.
4. A few years ago I got into AMD at about $9 when everyone was screaming about how they are going to go bankrupt and Intel reigns supreme in everything. 

One of these companies will always look stronger depending on who most recently updated their architecture.

Apparently AMD could be a very good buy given their new partnership with Sony and Microsoft for their upcoming gaming consoles. Both companies used to use Intel but have switched to AMD. Besides this, AMD’s products generally cost less than Intel’s, so there may be a shift in the market where AMD replaces Intel as the go to for computer processing.

3. From my understanding AMD made a bit of profit on the design of the chip , probably got some good R&D/IP that MSFT and SONY helped paid for, but TSMC will produce the chip and AMD will basically make nothing per chip so it doesn't matter if they make 5 million vs 25 million ; so even if consul sales sell way more then expected this won't really benefit AMD from my understanding.

What’s your pick for a long term (5-10 year) hold, and why? 

MU has an awesome P/E ratio, but is a much smaller fish than say INTC. NVDA seems to be benefiting from crypto/GPU but what about IF the world realizes all that electricity is simply going to waste and/or there’s a better way?

I’d like to add a chip maker to my “high risk” portfolio. 

Top Comments:
1. MU is a small fish compared to AMD? 6x market cap and more profit than AMD’s revenue is small fish? 
2. I like NVDA > AMD > INTC. Nvidia has most successfully capitalized on graphics and capturing AI/self driving car/machine learning. I think AMD has much larger growth potential at this point than Intel, who will be fighting to *not lose* market share to a revitalized AMD. Intel is the safest of the 3 ""computer-oriented"" semiconductor companies, but my least favorite of the bunch as well.

As far as other semiconductors, I would much rather go with an ADI or TXN than MU. Analog Devices is really going nowhere, and has a much stronger track record than Micron. Texas Instruments is another strong semiconductor player, and I would place them above Micron as well.
3. NVDA and add in some $SQ

Until win 10 gains a majority share because they are locking down Mantle with DX12 and it's going to take time regardless for devs to utilize it.  
Win 10, Microsoft and their privacy issues are not helping to bring this on. Perhaps they might get the next consoles which are still at least a year away from  build. 

Thier lack of any gains in the mobile arena are hurting.

The VR scene seems to be an emerging market, but it is still young and not guarenteed. 
The rise of China's middle class will be a positive, but most are mobile. 

I believe their collaboration with Dell will be seen as a positive and that might be thanks to having a Dell executive on board. Dell carries a ton of government contracts, which is good money

It's going to be Luke warm and there will be plenty of ""not good enough"" bull. I would anticipate a contraction to 1.65 again and then this roller coaster until dx 12 takes hold. 

If the consoles were smart they would enable DX12 / mantle and just update their hardware to modern cards with the same price point. This would extend the life cycle of their current consoles and hold off the need to completely revamp hardware all together for a few more years.

AMD has had success with partnerships with Square Enix and cross promoting Deus Ex.
If I were them I would jump on this Final Fantasy VII remake to really show off mantle / DX12 and use FFVII to once again blow the socks off everyone. What a wonderful proof of that technology it would make.
3. Without knowing anything on the business end... yeah.

Competitive gaming is exploding, which a lot of their revenue is going to stem from.

The company's book value has decreased nine-fold from a five-year peak. Also, mounting debt. The company has negative equity with little hopes of paying it back if the company is losing money.

1. Margin and revenue forecasts disappointed. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-17/amd-forecasts-sales-that-may-fall-short-of-estimates-on-pc-slump.html

You've got to understand that consensus estimates != market expectations. The shares are up 70% YTD, so the market was clearly expecting a beat. When the market is looking for a beat, and you come in in-line with earnings and slightly below estimates on guidance, that's going to be bad news for the stock. 
2. Here is your answer.

But AMD said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to rise only about 5% from the third period.

""This wasn't enough,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who said he had been expecting 17% sequential growth in the fourth period.

When it comes to Earnings there are 3 Factors.
EPS/How much money they made/Forecast

5% is not enough to wow investors. 

3. More was expected.

4. Part of it is that the market bet on the console processor wins and didn't see a big enough uptick to justify them staying in the game. They don't really understand that industry they bet on.

They are afraid of tablets creating low demand for the PS4 and the XBOne. Obviously, this isn't going to be the case, but all they see is a massive bet on a ""dying"" industry because Intel is gobbling up the PC space.

hzndv3,investing,"Post: STX, WDC and other storage companies tanking while AMD, INTL and MSFT pointing to increased server/PC sales

Many of the companies that are valued highly are pointing to increased PC and server/cloud sales due to COVID-19. In theory, shouldn't STX and WDC benefit from that as well as every device needs storage?

Please help me understand. Even if they are low margin business, increased sales should result in better numbers right?

Top Comments:
1. Hard drives used to be pretty much the only storage option for PCs. Now flash storage is getting cheaper and cheaper, so for a lot of applications, it is simply better to use an SSD instead of a hard drive(especially with laptops which are more popular than desktops), which has stiff competition with micron, Samsung, and SK hynix making flash storage, and a myriad of players using them to make their own ssds.
2. Spitballing here, but STX and WDC were and probably still are dominated by sales of magnetic storage, which is on its way out. They've pivoted slowly into solid state storage, but they're not the technological leaders, and they lack the state backing of some of the big Korean storage companies.

2. Them doing well is already priced in. They need to do exceptionally well to justify their current price while Intel does exceptionally poorly. That aside, acquisitions are tricky and if they aren't done right then they can turn into a dumpster fire. This acquisition is funded by AMD's investors through stock dilution which is probably why AMD is going down. AMD has a market cap of $89bln and they are going to issue new stock worth $35bln in order to buy a company valued at $29bln. AMD hasn't explained well why they are paying a premium for the acquisition, so that may be what it comes down to.
3. I wouldn’t exactly say I’ve seen a lot of hate on AMD lately. The only problem I’ve seen is that they could be acquiring Xilinx at a inflated value. But long term there’s not really much to be concerned about.

ez8e6g,investing,"Post: Thinking about investing between AMD and Microsoft

I have 2000$ to invest and I found that AMD and Microsoft have the potential, but there are certain concerns. I decided that today is a good time since the price of gold went down. 

My biggest concern is with Tesla's bull run, which could pop and it could lower other tech stocks by a bit. 

I see some short-term potentials (1 year) for Microsoft with it's upcoming release of XBOX. Not only that, but I see Microsoft having more potential than Facebook with their technology innovation, such as their glass storage. 

AMD has recently become mainstream to compete against Intel. They are also contracted to make the CPU for the next gen console. 

What are your thoughts on the matter? I'm more inclined at investing that 2k in MSFT and then for decide for AMD later.

Top Comments:
1. Buy TECL if you have guts and FTEC if you don’t. You’ll get a basket with all the tech giants.  TECL is 3x leveraged so when Microsoft moves it moves in a really big way.
2. Out of the two I'd go with MSFT... I like AMD but it has been become a bit of a meme.
3. Where do you see both companies in 5 years?
4. Why not split it between the two?

Both companies are strong, it’s probably less wise to guess which one will do better.
5. I’m in on MSFT and expect them to hit 200 pretty soon(in 3-5 weeks). I’d get in while you can now. Don’t think Tesla should have much effect on them, maybe even a positive one from Tesla sellers reinvesting in Microsoft. Good luck",05-02-2020 11:47
1ghpfdn,wallstreetbets,"Post: Is anyone else buying up AMD like it's GOLD right now?

The stock is down this week, and I'm convincing myself this is a buy-the-dip moment.

The reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.

This ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?

Am I crazy, or is this dip insane? Definitely time to buy.

3. $AMD has been here. $AMD will be here. $NVDA and $AVGO have benefited the most from the cloud computing/hyperscalers hundreds of billions of investments, but only the most funded companies have been able to truly capitalize on that spend. 

$AMD continues to put well made processors into everyday products that consumers love and use. Maybe it’s just me, because I need high powered desktop computers to do my day job. And I’ve only used $AMD processors for the past decade. 

For that reason, I will continue to be long on $AMD, and especially as long as Lisa Su is CEO.

Hear me out

While everyone is drooling over NVDA, AMD has been quietly positioning itself for a massive AI breakout.

1. **MI300: The NVDA Killer**
AMD's MI300 chip is set to disrupt the AI GPU market. It's not just hype - Microsoft and Meta are already on board. This beast could capture 20-30% of the AI data center market, eating into NVDA's lunch.

2. **Xilinx Acquisition: The Secret Weapon**
Everyone's sleeping on the Xilinx deal. This isn't just another boring acquisition - it's AMD's ticket to dominating adaptive computing and edge AI.

3. **AI PCs: The Next Big Thing**
Forget about data centers for a sec. AMD's pushing hard into AI-compatible CPUs for PCs. This could be a massive, untapped market that NVDA can't touch.

4. **Lisa Su: The 4D Chess Master**
AMD's CEO isn't just smart - she's related to Jensen Huang (NVDA's CEO). It's like a tech soap opera, and Lisa's playing the long game.

5. **Potential Earnings Explosion**
Analysts are projecting AMD's earnings could hit $10 per share by 2026. Do the math - that could push the stock to $300+.

The recent dip? That's your golden ticket, regards. While the market's freaking out over some China drama, AMD's busy laying the groundwork for AI domination.

Let's ride this bitch to Valhalla

2. You don’t buy AMD over Nvidia.
3. AMD is an Intel competitor, and did a good job at it because Intel fucked around with their R&D and didn't make any of their milestones for over a decade. Partly that is due to them being arrogant when they had monopoly power.

Most of Nvidia's profit comes from data center/AI cards. AMD really isn't a competitor on that front. Maybe in 5-10 years when they have a good solution and Nvidia takes their foot off the gas, but I don't see that happening.
4. don't compete in necessarily the same markets ie) NVDA does not produce cpu's.. there is some overlap naturally, but AMD can erode NVDA's market share position over time, the same way they did to Intel over the past decade. Customers increasingly want competition in the market & AMD will offer alternatives on-par in performance & likely cheaper. AMD will never become the market leader probably, but NVDA currently owns 92% of the market from what I have read. AMD has 3%. AMD has much more to gain & NVDA much more to lose. probably more upside to AMD than NVDA at this point at time as well, considering the run NVDA has been on. In truth, they are both going to be winners, but NVDA seems more of like a short term play given its current position whereas AMD seems more like a 1-3 year play.

1g8gajx,wallstreetbets,"Post: I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you. 

If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. 

https://preview.redd.it/e2tzzcmjy0wd1.jpg?width=1942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f0f907afeaf646562e6d6e20b0ab4099f9c38c6

Some of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.)

In my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time.

A quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.

https://preview.redd.it/hd4mviffy0wd1.jpg?width=1930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8987a1dab26da66ba129a56fd4b0e5122154c5

I do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. 

My positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost \~.30)

1ghyq7o,wallstreetbets,"Post: Why I think TSM/INTC will outpace NVDA/AMD growth in the next decade. 

Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:

* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.
* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.
* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.
* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.

However not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.

Lets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:

**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).

**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).

All those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.

Just to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):

A **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!

That's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.

As more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)

And this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/09/25/how-to-write-amazing-generative-ai-prompts/?

“Intel is betting the success of its Gaudi 3 on its lower price and lower total cost of ownership […] Intel indicated that an accelerator kit based on eight Gaudi 3 processors on a baseboard will cost $125,000, which means that each one will cost around $15,625. By contrast, an Nvidia H100 card is currently available for $30,678, so Intel indeed plans to have a big price advantage over its competitor”

5. Nobody cares if the chip is 600 times faster than an EPYC processor in AI performance because nobody uses EPYC  processors for AI. They use a GPU  with tens of thousands of vector processing cores. And nobody will invest in rewriting AI tooling to support their new babies if it is not significantly faster per watt and they can trust it will be around for a decade. Intel currently doesn't inspire that confidence. 

Also all of the big AI companies have ( Google) or are working on ( meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft) their own tensor processing units. Why should they jump out of nvidias grubby maws and jump right back into another ecosystem they would be caught in. Amd has the biggest chance to take some of that pie because their gpus are almost identical in many ways to nvidias and have CUDA emulation. The gaudi stuff of intel forces you to run a tool to rewrite python code. Sure that works great and fit really well into their development processes.",25-09-2024 23:55

Backstory:

I am a retired surgeon who transitioned to a full time day trader. I focus on a single ticker with only occasional deviations to other companies. My intra-day trades usually last less than 1 minute. Swing trades are between 1 week to a few months. Since 2008, I have never lost money in a calendar year. My goal was 7 figures last year which I achieved. I lowered that goal to a more attainable 500k this year which is technically achieved right now but not completely realized. I trade stocks and options (I sell a ton of calls to you guys here).

&#x200B;

Edit:

I started buying mutual finds in high school. Then, dot-com hit and I traded tech stocks. It was expensive. Broker assisted trades were $125 per trade back then. Then online trading started at $30 per trade. I took $2,000 and turned it into over $150,000, and then lost most of it. I got greedy. I learned (the hard way) to set goals early and book profits when goals were met. Risk management was the next hard lesson to learn. Eventually, I decided to go to med school and used all my trading profits to fund school. I continued to trade during school and graduated debt free. I moved to the USA in 2008 with virtually nothing and started from scratch again. I saved enough to open a brokerage account with a few thousand dollars. It took 18 months of slow trading to get to over 25K and finally I could day trade without dealing with PDT rules. And here we are now.

Saw many laughing when people suggested Nvidia will reach 300, and then 400 and said it'll fall because 500 is too much.. 

What about AMD? 
Is it a possible fomo train?

2. No. It wasn't magic that lifted NVDIA. It was their product which is way ahead of the game.
3. Just do the opposite of what everyone says here😅
4. No. AMD is not NVIDIA
5. What COULD (and is unlikely) to happen is every big company will want to create a unified platform to replace CUDA to run on anything, like OpenCL or Vulkan.  Once they all agree the jig is up, but the benefit is that NVIDIA got things right and have the best hardware so it's a war on 2 fronts.  Vertical companies like NVDA and AAPL have run away with the industry and the stale intel/amd and khronos architectures are in a state of continuous death.",24-05-2024 12:53
ljp713,wallstreetbets,"Post: Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon

Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

1. I can confirm an rx580 I bought new for £90 a year ago sold for over £200 on ebay last month.
2. The real reason AMD is going to succeed is because WSB pumped AMC and AMD comes next alphabetically
3. I bought AMD for $2.00 in my IRA after my financial advisor had a mid life crisis and lost me thousands of dollars before getting fired. That's how I got into managing my own stuff.

One of these days I need to get an account for play money because my generation is never actually going to retire, the earth may be largely uninhabitable by then.
4. I sure the fuck hope so retard as I have some LEAPs on $AMD. 

Nice DD op.

Edit 1/23 $70 strikes. Just starting to print. Might pick up another next week.
5. Nice writeup OP.

Point #4 is what has kept me from getting into AMD up to point. I've been getting my gains elsewhere while AMD trades sideways, which it does notoriously. But I think the pattern is going to break soon and AMD will go on its next bull run. But that could be this week or not til April, so LEAPs are the play.",14-02-2021 14:19

1bescke,wallstreetbets,"Post: Next generation of chips, NVDA vs AMD, looks bad for NVDA

AMD's new chips will be a bit better irrespective of price, and will be twice as good per dollar.

If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.

NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price. AMD is about to do that to NVDA in GPUs.

Also I hear NVDA engineers have gone soft now they are all rich.

2. Nothing matters as long as every single framework for DL is running on top of very specifically handcrafted (and probably specially optimized in NVDA drivers) CUDA kernels.

CUDA is what Windows is/was to Microsoft.. there was no (sane) alternative so everyone just hardcoded shit for it into everything and now we have to keep on using it because there is too much CUDA specific shit.

Until legislators figure this out and slaps NVIDIA with some kind of antitrust they will just steamroll the competition, they can charge whatever they want there is no alternative ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
3. OP thinks the moat is hardware. Anyone can make faster hardware. Moat is software & services. Welcome to the Nvidia walled garden, everything is faster here
4. NVDA hardware + software blows AMD into oblivion. The software is the key
5. I swear to god if anyone else calls CUDA a moat I am gonna scream. LLM training on large clusters is already about on par.

1ehjuzj,wallstreetbets,"Post: I bought $700k worth of Intel stock today 

https://preview.redd.it/83gh52szi2gd1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba99bb67e4b11aa973fe830f535c775083bbc05

TLDR: Grandma died 2 months ago. Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. 

Here's why I like Intel: 

- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY 

- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. 

- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. 

- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. 

- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD 

- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. 

- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024

- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. 

- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 

- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry 

- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)

I've been on and off WSB since all inning $AMD at $5 in the Lisa Su mommy meme days. Some friends sent me the CVNA post from yesterday and figured I'd toss mine up. I tried making a DD post in late 2022 but didn't have the karma sadly. I believe I know the company better than just about anyone that isn't an internal exec.

Buys were done anywhere from $7 to $220. Rode it through a 98% drawdown and kept buying more, at one point was down about $10m on it.

Basic logic:

1. Selling cars online will be more popular over time
2. CVNA was the only large player doing that, smaller ones liquidated (Vroom and Shift)
3. Used vehicle market super fragmented so they're competing against Billy Bumfucks Bad Deals Dealership
4. I had data showing the company was cutting costs as expected and continuing to sell cars even when headlines were saying bankruptcy
5. I held as I had data showing continuously accelerating car sales over the past 18 months, with this quarter growing >50%
6. The valuation math was super sexy if they just didn't go bankrupt and grew.

Overall a fun ride. I think the stock does alright from here but sadly I doubt it 70x's again. I'd been blogging incessantly about it since late 2022 and had numerous of their execs reading. Internet DD is not always worthless!

Feel free to AMA

Cheers.

1b4zhmt,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD calls 📞🚀🌕 let’s go!

I anticipate AMD will skyrocket 🚀 after the next earnings report next month. I took a position today and I am hoping to increase it next week. Dell earnings and news were promising and propelled NVIDIA and AMD to new all-time highs. Unless we see a supply change disruption these chipmakers will continue to soar. If NVIDIA can’t continue to get those chips fast enough guess who all the big AI companies are turning to for their chips. Nvidia is the big shark in the ocean, but AMD’s market share is increasing rapidly by the billions. So at even 5% of the market share of what AMD is projected to earn with AI that’s a big reason to wake this sleeping giant. I’ve been in this stock long and I wouldn’t be shocked if we see it skyrocketing over $250 per share next earnings. Nvidia has CUDA which is what most programmers want, but AMD chips can also work on CUDA unfortunately they cut the project short. I can also see INTEL producing chips designed by AMD and manufacturing them as well. Who else is in on this and sees the potential? I’ve already doubled my money on NVIDIA.

5. Been with AMD and loading up on every dip since last May.

It shocks me to see that not a lot of investors are looking into AMD as a winner and a potential 10 bagger. 

AMD always has been and is currently 100% under appreciated because it's not sexy and not named NVIDIA.

It's been under owned for the better part of the last 2-3 years.

Only till recently, AMD has been getting attention hence the run up but that's due to it being neglected and under owned lol.

Next ER just around the corner, they will smash it and break records as this will be their first quarter with AI chips in their books.",02-03-2024 21:37

1ef0p85,wallstreetbets,"Post: $AMD earnings

AMD earnings are coming up and I think it has a good chance to beat expectations and the future of amd looks good and just wanted to know what everyone thinks about it

Intel has some heavy backlash right now, their 13th and 14th gen chips stability issues have made people go to amd instead of intel. In the PCMR subreddit the first comment people type when someone has a build with a intel chip 13th or 14th gen is something like ""stability issue, bla bla, be careful, go 7800x3D""

Unlike nvidia amd still has a significant portion of their revenue stream come from gaming, so people complaining about intel is good for amd

Their gpu's are better value than nvidia and I see allot more people pick them now in my opinion. (for example the 7900GRE, 7800XT or 7900XT)

2. It's AMD earnings so that usually means beat, raise, crash
3. Earnings are always a risk.

I love how Su Bae and friends are running AMD. It's an engineers' company that focuses on designing quality products, and they are managed incredibly financially conservatively (I like the word ""prudent""). Their debt to equity ratio is microscopic, maybe the smallest in Big Tech. And they always invest their FCF in R&D before share buybacks.

You couple that with their competition being a bunch of chuckles who do the exact opposite of those, and I think AMD will be very secure as long as Su is in the chair.

But will that translate to making a lot of money *tomorrow*? Who the hell knows.

Long term, they are a buy. For weekly options, it's the same as ever. You pay your money and take your chances.
4. I've got calls, I think it dipped too far to not buy before earnings
5. Gaming is such a small market for nvidia/amd.. datacenters is the money maker",29-07-2024 14:18

1emldft,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle': 'There's Tremendous Need For More Compute'

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.”

**What To Know:** Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust.

Su’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.”

AMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion.

Su highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said.

“Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added.

Although the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.”

AMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.

And they're right! IT is the best ever, they have their products scaled to cover all the segments they're striving for. They've always been competitors to NVDA, Intel, Micron, and I'll even throw in Marvell another company I love. However, similar to GME's hold on the gaming shopping experience and console dominance, AMD has that same strength and capability being that they are powering the PS4 and Xbox, but more importantly the **PS4**!! I don't need to explain how the gaming industry has boomed, if ape need more look at **PENN** chart! Add in the fact, their highly highly profitable and beloved Radeon and Ryzen combo, like... I want to build a computer, don't know how to do it.... But if an autist like me can identify chips by the name Radeon and Ryzen and not ask if its a **Pokemon**, we str8! Even if you don't know what these chips are or do! Trust me, they generate tendies like your cam model crushes!

&amp;#x200B;

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

I take that back now

Upvote = no

Downvote = yes
3. Holding my MVST calls over the weekend. Super bullish next week. I think we see 16.
4. MVST super bullish
5. MVST is not a meme stock. This is a leader in the EV battery industry which has yet to be discovered by the mainstream retail market. Aka a SLEEPING GIANT. This is not a pump and dump, this is a buy and hold. Thank yourself in a few years.",06-08-2021 12:01

Bought last hour of trading averaged down. 

Reasoning is the stock seems cyclic peaks and troughs about a month apart if this would like to drop 5-7% by Tuesday close of market I would be happy lol.

Breakeven around $164.20 I’ll sell for loss if it crosses $172 Monday. Other than 10/1 it had a really nice run every other market day and I typically look for reversals.

RSI in overbought territory time to take profits and let that baby slide lol.

##Update after earnings:

https://i.imgur.com/oAyVo5a.png

As you can see in the graph, my projected loss wasn't that bad even at the low of $46.10. 

I plan to hold and continue selling covered calls until this is profitable, or will take a loss if AMD drops to around $44.
4. Call premiums looked good, so I just wrote 16x $53 covered calls on them for $1.13 each. Max gain $1808 on it before fees. Didn't do a full 20 since I want the other naked calls to be covered just in case.

Cost basis on shares reduced to about $49.386 from the call writing.

1b1l8z7,wallstreetbets,"Post: How the hell is AMD stock not skyrocketing right now?

Last time I checked, the whole reason why Nvideas stock has been going up this whole time was because for workplace environments like rendering, certain programs used Nvidea's Cuda technology and didn't work as well on AMD cards. If that is the case, why haven't people started investing more into AMD stock when it just came out thar AMD has been secretly making ZLUDA (a past open source cuda alternative for Intel cards) try to work on amd cards. It's apparently been in development for the past 2 years and AMD is actively ZLUDA 3. It's out right now and it will only get better. Besides the fact Nvidea has a mainstream control of AI, once AMD gets their open source cuda implementation up and running smoothly as equal or even better than Nvideas closed source cuda implentation in the next couple years, won't this just make nvidea stock price drop? AMD will have more competitiveness if they are able to compete with Nvideas actual Cuda technology and therefore will just sell more gpus.

Maybe I'm just a lunatic, but isn't investing into AMD more logical than Nvidea at the moment. Am I cooking up something and not just being an idiot but instead a master mind genius?

Only time will tell, I'm going in on AMD for the foreseeable future.

2. AMD is up almost 30% year to date. Yeah. Not as impressive as NVDA but impressive anyway. they still need to deliver on the earnings the same way NVDA has done for them to rocket at the same level. But come on… 30% in 2 months….
3. Right now Nvidia has a battle tested operational product with tangible and immediate positive ROI applications. AMD is still a “we’re trying to get in on this, too!”

Remember, before AMD was the AMD to Nvidia, there was Intel. And by that I mean AMD was the AMD to Intel, also lol. They spend decades being on the trajectory to catch up with Intel and compete in the CPU space without ever actually fully executing.

They have historically filled a similar role in GPU’s.

You’re probably right that the risk:reward ratio favors AMD over Nvidia but I think you overestimate the probability of AMD successfully replicating the commercial success of Nvidia. It might happen and if it does you’d get paid, but it also might not happen.
4. My AMD is up 163% in a little over year. Seems good to me.

I wouldn’t been surprised to see you calls near or in the money over the next few weeks or months. They’re LEAPS, well done. Weeklies, you’re toast. The overall market is probably going to rally into a blow off top into the fall. Look I’m bearish on the condition of the markets but they are showing bullish trends as of now. I believe the crash / correction everyone is looking and calling for is probably being delayed into fall this year or EOY. If AMD closes below $100 then my idea is invalid, this stock is great for day / swing trading. Lots of volatility and massive tute interest.

1eko1e3,wallstreetbets,"Post: This panic sale is an opportunity to buy

I think this sell-off is overdone. Unlike Covid, the economy is not shutting down. Unlike 2008, there is no big dynamo crashing. On the contrary, American companies are quite productive, their earnings insanely high, and US economy is doing relatively good. The biggest threat to the companies was Biden imposing taxes - even that is out. We are also up for a rate fall cycle, which just makes the money cheaper. 

TLDR: this is a panic sale. Could have been caused by fear and Japanese yen investors, but this has no wings. Buy, buy, buy!

Hello brother degens. Well essentially I got here by disregarding every basic financial/common sense safeguard and went all in daily/weekly n/otms on any slight daily sell off. I wouldn’t recommend it at all but honestly it’s none of my damn business what you do. Everyone around me is irritated that a guy making $20/hr two years ago just made a qm in 3 months and who can blame them. Stay the course. Worst thing you can do is work with some cool mf at your local Wendys plotting your next rise to glory.

Bought $RKLB calls each dip $3.50-$15 
40k $13.5 - $16 $RKLB weeklies for ER
$TSLA and $BITX flips on the side

Started with an all in at $3.5c and walked with my conviction and tuned out the noise. If you asked my honest opinion, $RKLB is just getting started. I’ve been around for $AMD $TSLA $NVDA and it’s showing promising signs and an exciting future. 

Closed ER play and bought $25c and will continue to pound options and shares as opportunities present themselves. 

Congratulations to the $RKLB bulls that just launched out of the deep dark trenches 🚀

n0kaye,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD: This is why it's down after earnings but will eventually rocket

See my previous AMD DDs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd\_increasing\_production\_by\_20\_in\_q2\_buy\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd_increasing_production_by_20_in_q2_buy_before/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the\_amd\_boom\_is\_still\_coming\_heres\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the_amd_boom_is_still_coming_heres_why/)

Everything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.

I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  
""This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.""

One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers ""digesting"" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.

One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.

One could speculate that the ""chip shortage"" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.

All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.

With AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.

AMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022.

UPDATE: BoA upgraded AMD price target from $100 to $110 and named AMD their #1 pick in all of computing. Rosenblatt has a $135 price target. It's only a matter of time before upward pressure overcomes downward pressure and this thing explodes.

Top Comments:
1. I am not going to speak to the why it is down, but I have done a few different DDs on the semiconductor industry and the OP is correct.  AMDs stock being below $90 right now is fucking stupid.  

Their earnings release showed just how deep they getting inside the data centers that Intel used to feast on.
2. Ok, I'm going to tag my thoughts about AMD in the datacenter as a system admin/engineer in a medium size company with massive growth goals over the next 5 years.

We absolutely aren't looking at ARM chips for datacenter work, and their lack of compatibility with legacy line of business software is a drawback for even end-user work. (We're using entirely x64 traditional architecture in our fleet right now.)

As Hyperconverged network/virtualization/storage/compute infrastructure continues to grow in the datacenter world, AMD will need to compete with non-traditional companies in this sector like Cisco, but I believe the cost of Cisco Hyperconverged infrastructure limits their appeal to many SMB size companies.

Lastly, I see regular advertisements from HPE (our current vendor) showcasing the benefits of AMD processors in the datacenter, but I see little from Dell EMC and some other vendors we are working with. If AMD can secure the kind of exposure they are getting from HPE with other vendors and increase their name recognition and reputation in the Datacenter market, thats going to be a massive boost to sales.

\*Disclosure\* I own AMD stock, my personal machine has an AMD processor, and I would do unspeakable acts for a 6000 series graphics card. Do your own research, and I am not a financial advisor.

Tl;Dr: AMD make expensive machines go brrrrrrrr, I like the stock, etc.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger! It is the first I've gotten.
3. Holding 4000 from $13 from 2017. 

Have seen this manipulation countless times.

AMD is like a coiled spring. Hedge funds try to put the pressure to fit it in a box but even a slightest mistake and it uncoils and hits them hard in their face. 

The pressure is building on Hedge Funds. They have been trying to push it hard. Sooner or later it will recoil and jump.
4. Thanks for this. I only have a few shares, but it's nice to see some method to the madness. Would very much like to make a few bucks; wish I could've afforded more when it was in the 70s!

mwu5jy,wallstreetbets,"Post: $AMD earnings coming for at long term winner

Ok Monkeys here is a short dd ( will make a more more detailed one if there is interest, let me know below)

AMD   sells chips to a variety of sectors but you can mainly categorize it  into to two categories: Computing&Graphics and Enterprise ( Embedded   and Semi-Custom). Basically if there is a need for calculations they   make the chips.  As you might have noticed there has been a supply  shortage lately causing semi conductors prices to sky rocket- if you  have been trying to buy one lately you will know. So AMD is a part of a  mega trend and there is a clip of the psycho CEO mama who has been on Sir shithouse aka Cramer telling him it is good for business ( cant post the video but you can google ""AMD CEO gives update on Xilinx acquisition and talks chip shortage impact"")

The CEO mama Su is nothing short of a genius. PhD in electro engineering from MIT she has been running the show since 2014 where AMD was a mess. I shall not go into the accounting details but basically she knows her   stuff and the development of the stock price reflects just that

From 4 dlls a share to now be around 80

&#x200B;

Intel  came out yesterday with a great earnings report but more or less  explicitly saying they are losing market share despite the market is hit  by a supply shock. AMD will report on Tuesday and if you fancy a bet  you can buy calls for that or you can just like the stock, or if you feel adventurous buy LEAPS.

Whatever the case AMD looks to be a long term winner with the best products,   best management in a sector that will thrive going forward. I dont   really consider it a long term risk and i hold it and have done so for   quite sometime

1c3yj60,wallstreetbets,"Post: Blackberry A Stunning Comeback AMD Partnership And Revenue Growth.

Blackberry surprised the skeptics and on April 3 removed the curtains and delivered better than expected revenues beating the street estimates for Q4 FY24. The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside. Taiwan based Foxconn is the make of Apple iPhone. At the Wold Imbedded Software Show in Germany Blackberry and AMD announced a strategic partnership on Robotics technology sending a shockwave in Germany and around the world. Blackberry is back in the spotlight , on  the world stage pioneering innovation in intelligent car software, robotics and so much more. Blackberry is an innovation icon, the Next Nvidia.

3. As someone who has BB calls expiring Friday, I have to wholeheartedly agree with this. I suggest everyone put roughly 30-70% of their portfolio into BB by Wednesday. I don’t care what you do after I sell my calls.

1dowoqn,wallstreetbets,"Post: Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.

Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom.

Original post:

Hello everyone,

I believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.

Last October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger.

To summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.

There's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.

So why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.

That's right. A 1.67T company is tapping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.

Proof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

So we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company.

Proof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)

So, let's list them out...

Catalysts:

1. $XLNX Merger
2. $TSLA contract
3. $GOOG partnership

This is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price.

So what am I suggesting?

&#x200B;

1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share
2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)

Is there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.

&#x200B;

[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)

&#x200B;

Here on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.

[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)

So. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...

We've got 3 approvals that have to happen.

1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.
2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems
3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.

Where can you verify these dates? I encourage you to google it. There is a SA article with them written down, but due to WSB rules I cannot post the link here. I highly suggest googling that data before you enter the trade.

What is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:

&#x200B;

You've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger.

[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)

How is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:

&#x200B;

[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)

So how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.

So what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert).

Buying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.

I am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.

&#x200B;

My recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow.

As a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.

&#x200B;

Best of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.

As a disclaimer. I don't take responsibility for anyone's gains and losses. While I am in this and have put my own money on it, I do not promise 100% sure success. Only my own idea of what will happen.

My position screenshot is below. I do edit out my current value and cost basis. I hope you don't mind but I am a relatively private person. My positions are not for everyone. I change them dynamically depending on how the stock is moving between dates. Please do not use my own as a template for yours.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/51me4r197q671.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2586486263ca15acef28f83f66a9796607d37f57)

Update: the UK regulator issues approval on 6/29. I don't know how much farther the trade goes in the short term. This is my last update. Best of luck everyone. I still believe we head towards 120 over the long term.

2. Pat Gelsinger made $187 million last year so him buying $500,000 worth of shares is meaningless. 

They had one of the worst ERs I've ever seen for a ""blue chip"" company last Quarter and gave investors no warnings ahead of time, like NVDA and WMT did before their ERs. This shows how little management cares about investors. 

Intel is a gamble on competitive process nodes and architecture in 2025. They will hemorrhage margins and market share in any segment where efficiency is key (DC, mobile) until then.

Intel looks cheap because you are looking back at a company with a monopoly on the 2 most lucrative x86 product lines, that is not the reality we are in as this earnings report shows. That company is gone, wishful thinking will not resurrect it.

Intel + IFS will be a new company in 2025, model it as such, understand the roadmap and the (huge) execution risk it carries and throw away the history because it's irrelevant.

I would also imagine that they could get kicked out of the DJIA eventually, in favor of AMZN and/or GOOGL.

Scheduled for **January 30th, after market close**, this call could be the catalyst for AMD's stock to finally **reach the coveted $200 mark**. But is it just wishful thinking, or is there real fire behind the hype?

**Why the Optimism?**

AMD's recent performance has been nothing short of scorching. **Fiscal Q3 2023 saw 4% revenue growth** despite a jittery market, driven by the company's **dominance in high-performance CPUs and GPUs**. The **data center segment, in particular, roared with a 45% year-over-year surge**, fueled by cloud computing giants gobbling up AMD's EPYC processors. And let's not forget the AI revolution – **AMD's MI300 series AI chips are expected to become revenue monsters in 2024**, potentially exceeding $2 billion.

**Analyst Whispers:**

Wall Street isn't playing coy either. The **consensus EPS forecast for Q4 is $0.77**, a healthy jump from $0.69 the year before. Some analysts are even whispering about a potential beat, propelled by strong data center and AI sales. This could send the stock soaring past its current perch near $180

**The $200 Question:**

So, can AMD crack the $200 barrier? It's definitely not a gimme. **A strong earnings report and bullish guidance would be the rocket fuel**, but there are still headwinds like potential supply chain disruptions and macro-economic uncertainties. However, **AMD's momentum and strategic positioning in booming markets** make it a **compelling buy for long-term investors**.

**What to Watch:**

During the earnings call, keep your ears peeled for:

* **Data center and AI revenue figures:** A healthy bump would be a green light for growth.
* **2024 guidance:** Does AMD see continued momentum, or are there cautious whispers?
* **Competition:** Any insights into market share battles with Intel and Nvidia will be crucial.

**The Bottom Line:**

AMD's earnings call is a high-stakes poker game. But with its strong cards and an ace up its sleeve in the form of AI, the odds of reaching $200 are looking hotter than ever. Whether it's a slow simmer or a full-blown eruption, AMD's stock is definitely worth watching. So, grab your metaphorical marshmallows and cozy up to the earnings fire – it's gonna be a scorcher.

2. Would be great to see a 100usd pump AND the rise of a new baby nvidia
3. Remember last nvidia earnings , shit tank after blowing out all metrics just becuase we knew it was gonna beat
4. Fuck it's so hard to think about it going to $200 from $177.
5. I think this will get to $250 after a healthy pullback. I also believe we will see nvda at $1000. That said, I think this goes to 200 off the heels of this ER if we get a big beat.",28-01-2024 18:03

1el43gi,wallstreetbets,"Post: People will look back and say they wish they bought the dip.

The market was overly bearish for stupid reasons. Nvda hit 90 pre market, AMD $115, and SPY $508. The regards were already pricing in a recession and those who were overleveraged on Japan loans liquidated. Easy dip buying opportunity. The manipulators were successful today, pumping out so much FUD it caused a dominos effect of negative news across all media platforms scaring the regards to panic sell. Congrats on those who saw through the bullshit and bought these lows, as of now its much higher. Remember, what drives stocks up is good earning, if they are still growing and printing money a stupid overreaction sell off is a buying opportunity.

2. I have never been more excited for earnings like how do you even come close to meeting expectations on this shit
3. This is scary; all Nvidia revenue comes from a single source of income, can you imagine what will happen if that revenue stops growing? It will get Google multiple.
4. Absolutely insane that it’s more valuable than Google.

Google is undervalued right now.

Google has the most data, literally invented the algorithms behind today’s LLMs, have an extraordinarily profitable business.

Edit: 30% of the planets population interacts with Google’s products *every day*

Of the 7 or so products worldwide with more than a billion active daily users, Google owns 4. 


Google has more data on YouTube, gmail, drive, search results than anyone else. Their company has been crawling the entire web for decades for their search engine. AI race will boil down to who has the most data and google will win. The underlying algorithm is something everyone has. It’s all about the data and Google has data like no one else.

&#x200B;

I would've expected them to be at about half that. Haven't been gaming for a while, not enough time. If I keep gaming I'll stay one of the poors. However, I used to pay attention to the hardware surveys, what people were using and how well it was working.

This is pretty big. Before Ryzen AMD was at about 3% market share, and steam polls hundreds of millions of PC's for this data.

I was holding off of throwing money at AMD despite being a bit of a fanboi because I've seen them put a lot of flops out in the past, but this has pushed me to the other side of the fence. They're taking market share in the server space almost as fast, and that's where the $$$ is.

Su Bae I'm Ready. Take me.

1exv9ju,wallstreetbets,"Post: All-In on Tech: Why I Just Invested $2.1 Million in a Single ETF

Hello Fellow Investors, I Need Your Advice!

Recently, my parents sold their house and entrusted me with managing the proceeds. I've just started exploring the U.S. stock market, and I'm a firm believer that technology is the future. Since tech can't thrive without semiconductors, I found the SMH ETF.

The holdings in SMH are nothing short of a ""dream team"" in the tech industry: NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML, AMD, and other semiconductor giants. In my opinion, investing in an ETF like this is better than betting heavily on a single stock, as it offers diversification without missing out on growth opportunities.

That's why I've decided to go all-in with $2.1 million and invest it entirely in SMH, with a long-term horizon of 10 to 20 years, following a value investing approach.

However, this is just my initial thought, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or feedback from experienced investors. Are there any better strategies or considerations I might be overlooking? Thank you!

3. The expense ratio of SMH is over 10x the expense ratio of VOO (SP500).

You are limiting your upside to the semiconductor industry, which, while large and growing, is a small fraction of the potential of tech. Why no software? Why no emerging technologies like VR, space, etc.

You are not betting on tech, you're betting specifically on semiconductors (a massively cyclical industry in its largest upswing ever)

I hope your parents know they raised a regard. Best regards.
4. Welp, it's at least better than gambling your grandma's money on Intel.

Also, ""fellow investors"" ?!? WTF ? Noone here is investing. Sir, this is a casino.

1. I bought 50 Sep 18 2020 calls at $0.20 per in April of 2020, I then held to September and started to sell and roll, that is, I would sell some, roll some to a later date at a higher price and double the positions.

So if I had 10 calls at $80 Dec, I would sell 5 and roll 5 to be 10 calls at $90 calls at Mar. Then later would sell 5 $90 Mar and roll 5 to be 10 calls $100 Mar. This way I'm locking in profits and maximizing future potential profits.

That said, if I had just rolled everything and not taken any profits, I would have turned that $1k into $200k so ... paper hands I guess.  


IRT to AMD:   
Idiots started selling AMD and buying Intel because Intel got a new CEO and they're like, ""What if Intel comes back and can compete with AMD again!?"" Even if Intel starts development on that right now, it'll take them 2-3 years to make the chip. Also Intel stock before AMD crushed them was \~$65 the stock is now \~$65. That's a big WHAT IF for the morons playing Intel and selling AMD, I see no up side potential on the Intel side while AMD is down 20% from highs.

So imma blow your mind ... what if AMD keeps their foot on the pedal and Intel never catches up? To me that's just as likely except prices are right for buying AMD right now. AMD makes up \~3% of the datacenter market, with their Zen 3 datacenter CPU coming out next week and TSMC investing 30 billion in production and building a fab in the US, it's still Intel's market share to lose and AMD's to win. Steve Cohen rated AMD as his #2 stock pick behind GOOG. It's a #1 BUY on Cramer's Action Alerts Club. Average price target is $103, high is $161. Stock is way below that.

I bought $50k in stocks and call options across multiple months, from April to Jan 2022.

mkljmv,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD Increasing Production by 20% in Q2, buy before earnings!

Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.

The news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:

[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)

They're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.

Because AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.

Another, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to ""ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP"" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.

I've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.

My AMD Positions: 550 shares, 55 calls spread from April 2021 to June 2022 at prices from $90 to $175

1. It is funny that AMD used to be this subreddit's darling yet very rarely we see anything AMD make front page. The bullish thesis on AMD is unbelievably strong. AMD is doing 50% revenue growth WITH chip shortages. Margins are growing rapidly and market share as well. AMD is entering new industries and new partnerships rapidly. Lisa SU has conservatively guided another 40% this year but with their usual beats this will be another 50%+ year, if chip shortages resolve could be 60-70%. Tesla AMD partnership has yet to be officially announced. It is likely waiting for the vote on AMD's Xlinix acquisition to be completed before they formally announce it.

AMD currently has P/E of 40 ..... for a company jumping 50% revenue a year. The stock price is heavily weighed down this past 6 months from Xlinix acquisition (which is done through stock sale giving XLNX holders a fixed AMD stock amount). Once Xlinix acquisition is completed and chip shortages are resolved, this rocket ship will take off and likely stock will jump 50% in a matter of months.
2. For any interested in semiconductors, know that the industry is comprised of the following:

-Integrated Chip manufacturers (both design and produce chips): Intel

-Outsource Chip manufacturers (produce chips designed by others): TSMC, Samsung

-Dedicated Chip Designers (design chips but let others manufacture them): Nvdia, AMD, Qualcomm 

-Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturers (design the equipment and services used to produce chips): ASML, Lam Research, Applied Materials

For the next year or so, I bet the Equipment Manufacturers are the ones that do the best.
3. first sentence seems to be not true according to TSMC CEO

he says double booking at his house due to china US tensions \*may drive chip shortage

[https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-head-says-drive-to-onshore-chip-supply-chain-is-unrealistic](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-head-says-drive-to-onshore-chip-supply-chain-is-unrealistic)

"" Liu also confirmed for the first time that there is a serious ""double-booking"" effect in the industry, in which clients place orders for more chips than they actually intend to use. As a result, Liu said, his company has to expend extra effort to determine which orders are truly urgent and which will wind up sitting on TMSC's shelves.""

I think this should be added to the equation before betting on one of TSMCs largest clients.

Consider this the start of AMD's new designation as the all-pile-on bull crazy parabolic stock to go in on. AMD Deep OTM FDs for all!

199mogx,wallstreetbets,"Post: Everything you need to know about AMD in 8 bullet points.

Everything you need to know about $AMD, in 8 bullet points.

1. $AMD's rise over the last decade has been the result of the company betting on chiplets. Chiplets consist in making a chip out of many small chips, instead of making a big one (monolithic) directly like $NVDA does. This is how it has disrupted $INTC and how it is now poised to disrupt $NVDA.

2. We are nearing the ""end"" of Moore's Law. Making monolithic chips is getting exponentially harder and therefore, chiplets are the way around the end of Moore's Law. They enable much  higher yields at similar if not higher levels of performance. $AMD has been working on chiplets for about a decade now, while the rest of the industry is only just catching up.

3. $AMD is just a bunch of people working together to design chips. The company's success is a result of having bet on the right roadmap (chiplets), but also of its excellent organizational properties. Lisa Su is a world class leader and ensures; everyone feels connected to the mission; employees are empowered and accountable; communication is extremely transparent. 

4. The market still doesn't quite understand why $AMD bought Xilinx. Essentially, Xilinx is the #1 FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) company in the world. FPGAs enable chips to change shape autonomously and adapt to whatever computational task. They have the potential, over the long term, to deliver much more efficient computing. FPGAs will allow $AMD to deliver AI acceleration in any of their products. 

5. $AMD also bought Pensando, which excels at making datacenters stateful. Stateful data centers hold information about their current state of operations. This data can then be used to train AI models, that enable organizations to run data centers at increasingly higher levels of automation. Pensando came with a lot of software engineers too and is essentially going to enable $AMD to provide the environment for their computing engines to do their best work.

6. The combination of the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions give $AMD a highly differentiated roadmap. For $AMD to bring chiplets to the world, it's had to fine tune its $AMD Infinity Fabric tech, which excels at connecting chiplets. $AMD is now positioned to use this tech to connect any kind of computing engine. This gives $AMD a structural competitive advantage, whereby going forward it will be able to fill specific gaps in the market that no one else will be able to.

7. $AMD is now transferring its chiplet expertise to the GPU market. $NVDA is busy making bigger and powerful chips, defying Moore's Law. $AMD is meanwhile coming from below, with the same strategy that it used to distrupt $INTC. So long as $AMD's organizational properties persist, it's a matter of time before its GPUs are atleast as competitive as $NVDA's. The latter has a strong software moat, but even a moderate gain in GPU marketshare could lead to considerable returns for $AMD shareholders.

8. In the Q3 conference call, Lisa Su said $AMD has made “significant progress” in the Datacenter GPU business, with “significant customer traction” for the next generation MI300 chip. Additionally–and in line with previous guidance–Lisa Su said on the call that AMD Datacenter GPU revenue will be: $400M in Q4 2023, implying a 50% QoQ growth of the Datacenter business; over $2B in FY2024. Q4 earnings will therefore be pivotal for $AMD.

1. What about the 9th bullet?

9. My Position ____
2. OP has weekly calls expiring tomorrow and needs AMD to pump.
3. All you need to know about AMD is that currently, AMD is what intel should have been, but they got lazy and greedy and are full of old people who don't know how to move forward.

The only difference is that AMD doesn't have it's own fabs. Intel and Nvidia are moving to chiplets, about 8 years after AMD did it, so that gives them an advantage. Meanwhile Nvidia has the software advantage by more than 10 years, and intel is safe because they have their own fabs which can't be invaded by China.

If you want to be safe, buy all three, because the future runs on high performance chips, and if you think any other company, or a new company, will be able to catch up to the expertise of these 3, you are delusional.
4. So I should buy NVDA calls with 1000x leverage? Got it.

3. The new X3D CPU has been expected by hardware news channels for a while now. Many had guessed that the announcement would take place on the 25th. But a now leaked invitation suggests that the announcement will take place on the 23rd.

Since this has not yet been officially anounced. I think this launch (early november) is not fully priced in. The release will be good for amd sales in the holiday season especially after the otherwise weak Ryzen 9000 series launch.

This could be a much needed impulse for the stock ahead of earings to slow the fall of the price.
4. All of this won’t stop the 2% plummet today
5. Also, I believe that they are also going to announce a limited RDNA3 refresh with some new GRE models, which might be limited to the chinese market.

This is most likely done to get rid of RDNA3 stock without having to announce price cuts.",21-10-2024 09:15

1biqt1k,wallstreetbets,"Post: DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction

Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**

AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.

I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.

1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio.
2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.

# Now on to my DD

The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.

**Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.

**Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.

**Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.

**AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.

# My price target: $450 AMD

After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.

AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.

**My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**

That's all. See you later this year.

I think AMD is undervalued and poised to capture AI market share. As a 250bil company,  any small gain has big impact on its valuation compared to Nvidia.

10je5rv,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD FEB 17 Calls the next 100x

First off, lets compare AMD to NVDA, They are always correlated and have the same peak to trough.  As we can see in the image below, AMD is lagging SIGNIFICANTLY to NVDA in their relief rally. It makes no sense for one to be lagging when they are basically the same.

[**https://imgur.com/a/tjzc4op**](https://imgur.com/a/tjzc4op)

So we just had a good earnings report from the chip manufacturer TSM.

[https://imgur.com/a/rjWmU9Z](https://imgur.com/a/rjWmU9Z)

Here we can see that compared to Q3, the Q4 sales of HPC which are the chips AMD sells are up 6%.

TAILWINDS: We have a massive tailwind narrative going into this year with all the OPENGPT hype. Everyone and their moms are talking about AI. And you know who makes these chips? AMD AND NVDA. 

[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-supercomputer-azure-150001119.html](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-openai-supercomputer-azure-150001119.html)

&#x200B;

AMD has earnings next week, and the IV on February 17th calls are HISTORICALLY LOW. The IV are these contracts are nearly yearly lows. I saw a stat its around the 17th percentile with 100 being the highest YoY.

[https://imgur.com/a/8Xp0Fgd](https://imgur.com/a/8Xp0Fgd)

NOW, look at the price for AMD OTM contracts. You can pick up the FEB 17 95C for .10. TEN FUCKING CENTS. If they have a good earnings next week, and the stock is already rallying today, we could see 90 dollars by NEXT WEEK.

[https://imgur.com/a/xTu3Pz9](https://imgur.com/a/xTu3Pz9)

This stock could rally to 100 by the end of the expiration. This is a 50x opportunity.

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: ""companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD’s newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today’s increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies — including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota — have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages.""

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

I'm getting ready to buy shares and a few LEAPS.

2. I am not losing money on Advanced Money Destroyer again, pass
3. I don’t think you can really rely on analysts’ target price. But I’m positive on it
4. Personally, I expect them to miss earnings. Q1 est was 0.61 and they beat by +0.1, Q2 est was 0.68 and they beat by +0.1.

Q3 est is 0.92. This is the second highest analyst estimate in their history, the highest was 0.94 (which they missed). What has so drastically changed with Advanced Money Destroyer that they expect earnings to be 30% better than last quarter? I’m not buying it, they’re gonna miss that mark.
5. If you take the last two earnings and the next two earnings estimates, amd and nvda have the same forward PE. Basically we need moar revenue from the mi300x series of chips and better guidance. Otherwise amd will be flat or down 5% like past earnings calls. 

I don’t think non gaap eps will be different from .91 estimate. But it being amd who knows how the market will react. I’m praying for Lisa su to deliver some miracles.",25-10-2024 22:52

1bmwmjf,wallstreetbets,"Post: $AMD vs $NVDA: A Comparative Analysis for 2024

Let's dive in...

Financial Data

Nvidia is projected to achieve explosive revenue growth in fiscal 2024 of 126% to $58.1 billion. AMD analysts model an acceleration to 21.9% growth in 2024 to $30.5 billion.

Analyst Opinions

Nvidia's software moat around CUDA is viewed as a key competitive advantage that will make it difficult for rivals to displace Nvidia's leadership position. For AMD, analysts are optimistic about continued share gains in server CPUs against Intel, and expect AMD to emerge as the clear #2 player in data center GPUs behind Nvidia.

Risks and Uncertainty

If enterprise adoption of AI is slower than expected or if hyper scalers shift workloads to in-house chips, it would impact growth estimates for AMD and Nvidia. Geopolitical tensions around AI and potential export restrictions are another risk factor.

Earnings and Profit Drivers

Analysts model Nvidia's GAAP operating margins can reach 64% by fiscal 2027. AMD is also expected to expand margins, with a long-term target of 35% adjusted operating margins.

j2q2wp,wallstreetbets,"Post: If you aren't in for AMD, you're missing out on free money

Hopefully, my name isn't too biased here. But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.

1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. 

https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k





2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.
      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards
      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable
      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling





3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. 

https://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule






 4: Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. 



https://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4





**IMPORTANT DATES**

AMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th

AMD GPU reveal October 28th

AMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)




https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi





The next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years. I am fully expecting them to crush it and finally be on Intel/Nvidia's level after years of playing catch up. 

*We don't need to bring up previous AMD driver issues* 







**My recommendations for options**

Full disclaimer. I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.


I will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. 





**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.
  
 - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. 
  
 -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11
   
-Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.





**20 Nov**
    
-My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. 
   
 - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. 
   
 -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. 





**15 Jan 21**

- Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.








EDIT: As of 5 October, I closed out my contracts last week when we hit $84 and waited for the dip at $81. Bought at open on monday (today) and am up another 15% so far.

Top Comments:
1. You write about options like your selling a bottle of wine. ""Ah yes, great choice. This 11/20 90c will pair greatly with an announcement the week prior. Should have a long finish with nuances of delta on the palate accompanied by a boisterous nose of sous boi and theta. Recommend closing early, however you may decide to exercise if you prefer""
2. To anyone reading this, you have to understand that Big Navi (Oct 28th announcement) carries significantly more weight than Zen3 + 4000 series.
___
The 3000 series and Zen2 have been crushing it. News about an incrementally bigger plug being shoved into Intel's enterprise and consumer CPU market is great but not earth shattering.

A competitive GPU against Nvidia's newest offering would be a much bigger story.
3. I have $17k worth of 11/5 $86 calls... it's my yolo.
4. wish I hadn't sold this bitch at $14.
5. I am bullish on AMD but you have a very good chance of getting KANG GANGED trying to buy and hold calls now through both announcements in October. AMD tends to trade sideways within channels and those channels are wide enough to crush your 10% OTM options in a single day.

I would recommend buying and playing the two events themselves, either day before (if you want to bet on a gap up) or day of. Buy weeklies and sell during the events. As we have seen from NVDA and AAPL recently, even very strong announcements get sold off in the short term and that selloff plus IV crush will destroy your profits 30 days out.

I personally think the Zen3 event will be the bigger of the two. AMD will be launching CPUs that beat the best Intel has to offer, and probably at lower prices. Zen3 has the potential to be a huge leap forward.

Your description of the NVDA ""battle"" is misguided in my view. NVDA is crushing AMD on market share and NVDA has the performance crown. With the very aggressive pricing of the 3080, NVDA has tried to cut AMD off at the knee because price:performance has been AMD's only selling point. The 30-series launch has been dramatic on Reddit, which is full of children who can't even afford shares, but it is actually a tremendously successful launch. NVDA cannot produce cards fast enough to meet what they've said was a 5-10x increase in demand over the 20-series at launch and initial inventory of both cards were similar. The ""huge driver issues"" have already been solved. The scalper/bot situation is bullish for NVDA because it shows demand is through the roof.

Consoles are generally priced in, AMD inked those deals a long time ago.",30-09-2020 17:02

Past 2 weeks $AMD has been betting on themselves with confidence. They announced a $4B buyback and today at 10PM they are announcing other new products such as 3nm and 5nm chips. Intel states their demand is low but that seems to be from AMD eating up at their market share because AMD's forward outlook is always progressing. 

Looking at the chart,  breaking out of $81 you can easily see $85-$88+.

li9o8m,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD and why Sue Bae is giving me a Semi (DD)


*Processing img 962rkkl28yg61...*

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) **- Advanced Mooning Devices** 🚀 have gained +12.8% over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of +28.7%. Business is good.

*The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.* 

If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' & 'why is my pp small'? 

Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $3.24 billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%. **For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $3.2 billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.** 

*Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...*

AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.

Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa ""Su Bae"" pointed out on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) that the supply constraints were in the ""low end of the PC market."" AKA nothing to worry about.

So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([**TSM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window. 

Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

TLDR: 

* [Su Bae](https://i.redd.it/3frlz1f1o2q21.jpg)
* AMD = Advanced Mooning Devices 🚀
* Record growth sector 
* High demand for company product
* Supply has been increased = more $
* Earnings late April for run up

Had a stupid year.  Was basically broke at the start of 2023, then AMD started to take off.  Somehow I hit 2 early 10 baggers on AMD (exercised 10 of the calls) and ADBE last spring.  And managed to buy 500 shares of META with the proceeds.  Put me at about 240k to start the year this year.

To start the year I bought 60 450 strike META March calls that I rode through earnings which really gave me a fuckload of cash.  Put most of that into the Micron positions above.  Cashed out of those today.  I'll provide proof of any trade anyone requests.

2. I've already lost money on this stock. Should I try again?
3. If you take the last two earnings and the next two earnings estimates, amd and nvda have the same forward PE. Basically we need moar revenue from the mi300x series of chips and better guidance. Otherwise amd will be flat or down 5% like past earnings calls.

If it does go down I will be buying more. I’m praying for Lisa su to deliver some miracles tho. You are a huge regard choosing 11/1 btw, 99% u will lose money, Godspeed.

Any FUKING Apes can see that. Nvidia always fuking delivers if AMD delivers. As a matter of fact, Nvidia will 90% of the time beat out AMD in earnings and sht.

If you dont belive me, go to your local Micro center and take a look at the GPU section, ton of AMD cards but NOT A SINGLE RTX cards. You know why? Cause all the fuking nerds are buying up Nvidia cards first b4 AMD.

NVIDIA EARNING IS COMING UP, IS FREE FUKING MONEY. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. AMD has good earnings so NVDA rises off of sympathy, and this retard thinks he’s a fucking genius now lmao.
2. Man you got me pumped. Ima Yolo the whole account on it
3. Nah AMD's growth and forecast significantly exceeded expectations.  Plus, as they stated on the earnings call, they've spent a significant amount of money to address supply chain issues (which is why there's more chips on the shelves).  On top of both, AMD covers a lot of space outside of PC and will be expanding into the automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors with the XLNX aquisition. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish on semis in general this year, but if you're basing it on PC chips, that is a fraction of what they actually do. If you heard the earnings call, the PC market is going to slow and AMD is actually expecting to remain flat in that industry.  However, they've thrived in other sectors like medical imaging, heavy equipment, etc.   Dont think NVDA will make a 25% move like AMD did.

Lisa Su is a genius and has been gearing AMD towards this since 2017. There can only be one Su...
4. IV on NVDA options will be crazy tomorrow piggy-backing off AMD’s big beat.

A ton of people here will buy options 5, 10, 20% OTM after it has already gapped up multiple percent points at open and then lose a shit a load of money.

With this move, other car manufacturers will be coming to AMD to get the same thing in their cars so they can compete. AMD will not have to go to them. $$$",01-06-2021 04:24

10q2f3i,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD puts are on the menu

If you don't own AMD puts going into the earning release tonight you have only yourself to blame for this missed opportunity.  Here is the logic behind a horrific earnings report:  
New AMD chips are slower than Intel's 13th gen Raptor Lake equivalent.  New IHS design creates excessive heat. Heat pipe issues with latest  GPU's resulting in replacements for customers on AMD's dime will negatively impact 1st quarter 2023 results.  When comparing sales of the latest CPU's, AMD is getting hammered by Intel.   


The only bright spots for AMD are sales of Tesla's are through the roof and they use AMD chips in their display, though the profit margin is minimal with these, and the new motherboards for the AM5 platform will push up motherboard chipsets sales.  


Comparison of top sellers on Amazon for CPU's (compare 7xxx to 13xxx chips)

1gumcrx,wallstreetbets,"Post: I think my friend sold me my calls on $SMCI

I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.

I buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh

Today, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”

So I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. 

If everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\*\*\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).

He knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.

Now I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.

So that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.

* Wednesday: SMCI 11/1 $60 Call (0.15 -> 2.0)
* Thursday: AMZN 11/1 $200 Call (2.0 -> 6.5)

* Wednesday: ETSY 11/1 $57 Call (0.40 -> 2.50)
* Thursday: INTC 11/1 $19 Put (0.10 -> 1.00)

by my calculations, I will turn 1000 into 1.25 million next week. see you on the other side gentlemen

EDIT: added alternative plays for Wednesday and Thursday as SMCI may not report next week, and betting on INTC to continue its downtrend seems reasonable (which - shocker - inverses general WSB sentiment); the contracts are also cheaper up front than amazon, so maybe more bang for your buck. also adjusted a few strikes based on a weekend review / comparison of volume / OI and my personal bias towards psychologically satisfying, nice round numbers.

anyway this is all regarded. don't take financial advice from a guy whose account is named after a transformer he made up when he was 12. carry on at your own risk

*AMD $99USD on 10/9* 

Last night I met with a girl I met on Hinge. Tinder was not working out, so had to be disloyal to the de-juicer app. After a while of drinking – disregarding the rona, for all we cared it was a hoax –  we went back to my place. I had too much to drink, little to no food. She kept climbing me but… it wouldn’t turn on. I gave her a quick excuse and went to the bathroom. This had happened before, and I had my loyal friend to back me up. I open my Viagra bottle, pop half a cap and wait. Then it hit me. My jr. stood up proud. It looked like a rocket. “To the moon” I thought. To the moon? A rocket. I gasped and dropped my anti-rona vitamins on the floor. As I picked them up I counted. I kept counting. 96…97…98…99. 99 pills. 99. To the moon. A rocket [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/). Something was up. I couldn’t grasp it. As I fondled the girl with a chemically induced rocket, I noticed her moans were different. “MMMMM”, “Aaaaaaaa”. M…? A…? It can’t be. She finished exclaiming “Deeeeeeee”. Her name. That was bizarre. But it hit again. I let go of my senses. A. M. D. To the moon. 99.

n4r47g,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gains

I read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/upndown#!\/vizhome\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock.  
Positions: I'm doing both strategies and own AMD shares and call options spread across this year and next year. I also own XLNX shares.

n4ncpw,wallstreetbets,"Post: Time to buy the dip $AMD - short DD

Hello fellow autists.

&#x200B;

Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.

&#x200B;

**Why buy?**

$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. 

They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. 

As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.

&#x200B;

**Chip shortage.**

The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. 

But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.

&#x200B;

**Final thought**

End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.

As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

2. I think they are about to bury Intel soon with all the issues they have. Seems like their plan with agreesive pricing on zen 5 and buying out an ai company. I’ll throw money at it if it goes sub 100 though lol.
3. There is too much money in circulation for AMD to drop sub 100. I get it, there is an argument that chip companies are overvalued but be realistic with your price targets.
4. Hope there are some relief rally next week before the ER…as long as it goes above 170 before drops to $100, I am happy.

1ch88j6,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD's Q1 Call... the good, bad & ugly

Regarded WSB Community,

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**.

2. Calls on cartels
3. Nvidia likely has 2 more years of market dominance due to AI. AMD and other hardware companies are working on tensor cores. Soon enough all your crappy devices will be fitted with hardware capable of training models based on your pathetic slovenly habits and replicating those base habits endlessly.
4. He's not wrong, after all - he would know more than others since he actually used to work for Nvidia before going to AMD.

1ak0ma0,wallstreetbets,"Post: Nvidia is now a national security risk.

With a market cap of 1.7 T nvidia has put itself in an unusual position. It has about 50 buildings world wide and outsourced it manufacturing. TSMC and the Chinese produce the physical chips.  Thing is, if something was to happen to a manufacturing plant, natural or terroristic because the supply chain and how little redundant manufacturing they have. Any hiccup would cause a catastrophic downward spiral. They don't need more cash and that's what an insurance payout would give.  They need a rock solid supply chain.

The real problem is to many institutions, 401k, and life savings are heavily propped up by nvidia. This makes it a national security threat.  A sell off of this magnitude or even correction is going to devastate our economy.

I personally believe they need to rethink and move their manufacturing to the USA. Their margins are high enough to cover the labor cost, and it is in the instrest of the USA for them to do so. 

I personally sold my nvida positions and calling it a day. Option spreads are ridiculous, and I feel like after listening to jpowl I want to buy puts on US economy. I do still hold position in amd and tsm...but yea...

Just wanted to get more regard eyes on this.

io1van,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD will 🌙 because of Intel's presentation

Not sure when all the casual people will catch on, but Intel's big announcement(which was a shitty window dressed marketing power point presentation) came off as insecure, petty, and scared.  They mentioned AMDs name like 37 times, used the words ""our competitors"" 17 times, and called AMD ""imitators""

They claimed to be above benchmarks because ""benchmarks dont show real world application"" and then proceeded to use a bunch of their own benchmarks in a real shady way...a bunch of misleading versions of their own benchmarks vs a rivals laptop they gimped up.

First, they kept claiming the AMD they used was their ""top"" one, when there are 4 skus AMD makes better and they used a lower watt version. They cut the ram down by 20% on the AMD they tested just because too.

Intel put this disclaimer on their site
 
"" Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel® microprocessors.""

Yeah dude, and my PS4 runs a lot faster than Xbox One  I poured beer on, placed a bunch of magnets on, and then hit with a hammer a bunch of times. 3x faster, 2.77 more efficiency, 300% better vs the xbox I measured all the features as a vague 1.0.


NVIDIA when they did their announcement never mentioned their rivals once. The benchmarks they showed were comparing their other products to the new one.

 Intel is scared. AMD, ARM, NVIDIA, AWS, are coming for big chunks of markets Intel gets its $$$$ from and their idea is to do the equivalent of ""alternate facts"" while coming off like someone obsessed with their ex.

Now no one can predict the exact time all  the common people will see through Intel's bullshit, so I cant give you an exact date for you to do an FD on. Im very bullish and long on AMD.

Don't get me wrong, there are a couple things Intel's new thing(they cant even get their name right because all their shit is like the IG48800UX+ or the IS4800UGX or some alien shit) does well...you just have to go out of your way to find those things because Intel is too busy trash talking AMD and running their own sketchy benchmarks (while saying benchmarks are unrealistic in the same breath) instead of promoting these things as much as they should. Maybe also give your stuff names your own people can remember instead of naming it like two Star Wars droids combined into one? Cant wait for the Juno Lake IG88C3PO+ desktop with chips the size of a toaster.

4. Did anyone else feel personally attacked with the whole, insecure, petty, and scared statement?  Screw it i am in.
5. Wheres the TLDR

&#x200B;

On more serious note, wasn't Nvidia also sweating balls before the 3000 series? Everyone was comparing Nvidia GPU and AMD GPU with the 2000series until the 3000series just blew it out of proportions. Intel might be similar. Their future gen CPUs could also set new benchmarks.

&#x200B;

What I am saying is, AMD is still a small player, even in the GPU industry. Don't discount the big boys yet. But I also agree AMD can become like Pepsi.",07-09-2020 05:44

Good evening you pieces of shit,

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. 

Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.

3. I wouldn't throw away half a can of carrots last night after dinner but I'll lose every penny in my account to fuck these assholes over. They created us.

4. I've pissed away 1200 already and I'll fucking do it again tommorow.

Call the cops I don't give a fuck.
5. Could GME really get over $10,000?

If you take the total number of shares in the market and divide it by 2.7m (total users on WSB), you average out at 12 shares per person. Adjusted for the whole market, let’s say there are 4m GME shareholders, with an average of 8 shares each.

Wall Street hedge funds have supposedly spent a fortune on GME short interest already. Let’s imagine that when this is all over, they have spent another $250bn to cover their short positions. 

$250bn/4m = $62,500

$62,500/8 = $7,812 per share.

All v over simplified but I think that indicates that we should be aiming far higher than the $1,000 a lot of people seem to have their eyes on. 

If you have any sell limits, look deep into your soul. Ask yourself why. And then cancel them. If we all hold, we can ensure the hedges end up with a far larger tab than $250bn 🚀🚀🚀",29-01-2021 22:35
nypg5f,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD GOING TO MARS IN 12 MONTHS!!! (THE MOON IS FOR AMATEURS!)

AMD's latest financial report blew all estimates out of the water... raising guidance to 50% sales growth Year-over-Year (up from 37%). And it is STILL conservative. Here's why:

**FUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT**

In a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.

As confirmed by TESLA & AMD last week, the NEW Model X and S have an AMD GPU & APU. This is HUGE, as the feature will trickle down as optional to the Model 3 and rest of the EV fleet.

Why is gaming important in the EV space? Just listen to Elon Musk drool over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving & AMD. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)

But that IS NOT ALL: Valve will LAUNCH an AMD portable handheld soon! HL3 anyone???

(source: Chris, The Good Old Gamer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)

In essence not only the PS4, PS5, XBOX X & S, but also Valve is going FULL AMD.

Who do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?

[MERCEDES ALREADY MADE THEIR CHOICE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dninScDsGno) You want a BENZ AMG??? You need AMD!!!

[AMD & MERCEDES AMG: Be the Changemaker](https://preview.redd.it/1o27ml9jzy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83cc982101a2836424ecabcfa053b1ed76353626)

**ENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it**

Software will be tailored to AMD's processing pipeline. As an example, **Unreal Engine 5** ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).

[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)

(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)

Unreal Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing obsolete. This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination, allowing it to work with non-RTX hardware.

Enthusiasts are pumped with AMD's Computex presentation, where Fidelity FX SuperResolution was shown. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K. And the kicker is that this solution will be OPEN to ALL platforms, including NVIDIA GTX and Intel.

**Intel's Raja Koduri** (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FSR (as per his tweet a few days ago). They want in!

[https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rajaontheedge\/status\/1399964541291622407?ref\_src=twsrc&#37;5Etfw](https://preview.redd.it/wx7f2kehxy471.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a8f175bc06e5c560b73411395c76497bcc319de)

**So yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING**

But on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.

It made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading around $72.

AMD is currently trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B

Nvidia is has a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).

But when you look at AMD's latest financials, the differences shrink.

On Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.

How does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? **It just doesn't**.

If AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.

At $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STILL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).

Think about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.

The reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.

The Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!

To summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.

The new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony, with more coming!

Add the Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property and fuel the rockets!!!

**REMEMBER:** In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!

The MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!

MARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!

**..... ALL ABOARD!!!!**

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention Samsung and AMD on their next flagship phone.

The phone is called ""Galaxy S22""... FFS!!!! What other signals do we need????

It isn't MARS anymore APES!... We taking over the GALAXY! :D

Load the Falcon Heavy with all the BANANAS!!! We never coming back! :D

Okay I just wanna point this out again. I'm Pretty sure this has been posted before, but this thing is ridiculous.

AMD beat their earnings this Tuesday (26/01). Many analysts are upgrading their price targets for AMD.  Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/l60it4/jp\_morgan\_increases\_amd\_price\_target\_to\_100\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l60it4/jp_morgan_increases_amd_price_target_to_100_from/)

Many catalysts are coming

Short interest is vastly increasing over the past months. Source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/short-interest)

Each morning AMD spikes up and after that it gets beaten down and it is bleeding till close.

It felt like there was a manipulation going, but now with GME, BB, NOK, ... surging, we finally see that AMD is being manipulated as hell. Robinhood is restricting the amount of shares u can buy to a number of **ONE SHARE**. Source: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/)

AMD hasn't had a significant bullrun like the onces mentioned before, but u clearly see that Wallstreet is scared of a potential move coming.

They have been dragging us down for a while now and it is holding back the potential growth a company can make. I am glad the GME move has revealed the underlying system whereby the rich are getting richer by dragging down companies.

I hope we won't give up and i pray for more tears from billionaires to come.

m79506,wallstreetbets,"Post: AMD to Jump 50% Soon to $120 and Here's Why

 AMD is trading around $80 right now, it's down about 16% from peak. It's movements are following the NASDAQ right now, meaning money managers are not trading AMD directly, they're just trading the entire NASDAQ. But they will be trading AMD soon and they will be buying. Here's why.

Dr. Lisa Su says they expect to grow 37% this year. She's always conservative on the numbers, more like 40% is realistic. Compared to Intel which is expecting 0% growth for 2021. Intel is being forced to slash prices to be competitive with AMD, which means reduced margins. Then they need to invest heavily in R&D to catch up to AMD. They also said they'll be using TSMC to make 3nm chips for them to help them catch up. Intel is a competitor to TSMC, so don't expect them to get any discounts. All of this leads to higher operating costs and further reduced margins. AMD will also be using the same 3nm from TSMC so don't expect Intel to pull away with a victory when the time comes (not for another 2 years), they're merely trying to catch up while they work on their own fab problems. It's possible that since AMD has such a lead, Intel may not catch up for the foreseeable future, >3 years. Remember AMD has a 100B market cap, Intel is 268B.

AMD holds 7% of the datacenter market, that number is about to skyrocket as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Tencent are going all-in on AMD powered servers. The datacenter is where the margins are the highest, this is what will make AMD serious cash, not their consumer products. And this is also where they have the most market share to gain, if they do it right, which they are.

On youtube /watch?v=xKj5sMVsMf8 (can't post youtube links on WB)  
Lisa Su on why the chip shortage is good for AMD and that they are ramping up supply to meet the new demand:  
On youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc

Current Price Target is $106 with a high of $161. My price target is $120. AMD stock history shows the stock tends to stay flat for months followed by a large jump within a 10 day period. I expect this to happen again. When will AMD jump? I don't know, but I expect it to happen within the next 3 months.

Last year I turned $1k into $87k with LOGI, I am now putting $50k into AMD, across stocks (350 shares) and several call options with expirations from April 2021 to June 2022.

1. AMD has been a great investment opportunity for a while now and they're really putting a lot of pressure on Intel, and to a lesser extent Nvidia. Great company with a bright future.
2. I closed my entire AMD stock position and went all in on jan 2023 LEAPS when they dipped to $74/share earlier this month. Solid ass company and products
3. People keep using the word ""shortage"" but it's more of a massive demand spike for all chips.  They are still producing just as many if not more than last year.
This is a good thing, gives them pricing power.  AMD gonna crush earnings this year

1ci0k60,wallstreetbets,"Post: NVDA will drop to 800 tomorrow because:

1. SMCI and AMD’s failure to perform will continue to bring the semiconductor market down tomorrow. The only reason why the burn was offset was due to Papa Powell giving the bulls a nice massage in the form of market calming. Every single serious question he was asked he deflected with “we gotta wait for the data”. The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward 

2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward 

3. Aside from Apple earnings there are no more positive events coming up that can justify the hype carrying the stock

2. My man is trying to inverse himself. Clever.
3. NVIDIA to $1000 tomorrow.
4. Here's an alternative

1. SMCI = Actually came in flat and reguided upwards on full year outlook. People need to understand that SMCI is a fraction of Nvidia's business. VRT is a great company and also a great partner in this exact same space so diversify that holding. Next, ASML guided upward the exact same way. More to come towards the back half of the year. Buy the dip. The reason for this is that their business model is completely different and cyclical to Nvidia's. 1 is pre-sale nvidia and 2 the other is post sale installation to nvidia. To put it in perspective, Jensen just delivered the 1st H200 to OpenAI. That took me by surprise. The 1st? I thought they had a million of those things out by now.
2. Supply chain constraints are the lifeblood of Nvidia's business. This is simply supply and demand microeconomics. While it may hurt an SMCI it does nothing but drive Nvidia's prices up. Also, this has a smoothing effect that I think will play out with Nvidia just posting strong earnings because it's not even fathomable how many chips are needed and what is even actually out there.
3. Everyone that is directly relating to Nvidia is actually posting good news that nobody is paying attention to. Samsung just had record earnings from selling phones and HBM memory. TSM reported strong demand for AI chips over their other chips that have nothing to do with Nvidia. Qualcomm just posted AH good earnings. Meta, AWS, Tesla, and Microsoft all reported increased CapEx spend to just purchase and do more and more AI. Meta got hammered for spending too much on AI lol. It's crazy.
4. Bonus. Nobody caught this zinger on the Microsoft call and this directly relates to Nvidia. The throughput you can obtain from Microsoft is being crushed downwards because they don't have ""enough"" capacity. They posted a +7% AI spend for their Azure revenues. An analyst asked Microsoft why wasn't it higher (effectively) and the response was because they just don't have the capacity to meet the demand. I can verify 1st hand this is true. They even went further to say that for Copilot they have dedicated capacity so that the demand doesn't affect Copilot usage.
5. I think Apple is a sleeper here. What better time, unless they drop after earnings, to buy Apple. If there is a time to get in it's now. The Rabbit and Pin are stupid and people will do all of those things on the IPhone and Galaxy phones. No need for another device. It's coming. QCOM Just reported strong growth on strong demand for the newest and latest AI phones. How will that AI work? From GPT on the Iphone.

oazs4f,wallstreetbets,"Post: Why I believe in AMD

So I’ve been following AMD since it was a $30 little boy share, and I’ve always believed in it long. Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here’s why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD.

###Who is AMD and why do we care?

**Advanced Micro Devices** (AMD) is a computer hardware development and manufacturing company at its core. They design and sell Processors, GPUs, APUs, and the like. For anyone who has been into gaming or building PCs, you’d probably recognize AMD as the “budget build”: the company who’s processors you buy when you don’t want to shell out $900 for a top shelf Intel. They have always been seen as an underdog in Intel’s shadow, with Intel having the superior clock speeds, Hyperthreading tech, and better clout when it comes to contracting.

###Next Gen Consoles

Currently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later). *AMD powers both.*

Let that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that’s about 6-7 more years.

###Server Hardware

AMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn’t rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share.

###CEO Lisa Su

Lisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China.

###The future of work

Lots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in.

###Semiconductor Shortage

The massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world’s “just in time” production model collapsing under increased demand.

I personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase.

AMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity.

###Get on the train before it leaves!

Once these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return. Boarding this rocket begins now! 🦍 🚀 🌝 

I hold 100 shares @84 average and some 12/17/21 $155 calls.

Also, I’m profoundly autistic, my late wife’s second boyfriend told me so. This is not financial advice, I am retarded.

2. AMD is in the logic gate design industry, NOT manufacturing. 

Intel kept their foundries which is why Intel has worse PE ratios compared to AMD and NVDA. Manufacturing is very capital intensive and low margin (generally). Obviously when they are all running at capacity, margins are great. Capacity is industry secret so nobody will ever know what capacity is and whether anyone is lying. There is basically no reason for foundries to advertise free capacity unless they are stupid. 

TSMC are killing it now though and gaining know how with EUV which is very valuable. Its also a strategically important industry which the Taiwan government will protect at all costs. Probably another reason why the US would go to war if PRC tries to invade. They want to keep China out of this bleeding edge technology. TSMC seem to be pumping chunks into Capex for plants in the US. God knows why they pick Arizona when they need water but hey ho. That said, I think there are better investments than TSMC. More on that later. 

AMD's main advantage is in CPU over Intel in x86. To this day, I cant allocate how much this is due to AMD being better in R&D than Intel vs Intel giving up on EUV with ASML. Either way, Intel screwed up huge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 vs new monolithic dies from Intel. Their latest product stack (Emerald Rapids) slipping into 2023 is great for AMD. Still stuck on 10nm. KEK

What the fuck is ASML? They produce the EUV machines for foundries. They have a monopoly on this. All foundries that want to use EUV must buy from ASML. ASML is printing money and cant invest it fast enough so gives dividends. ASML price has gone bananas but its probably still a decent buy imo. Their margins are huge because... they can be. Who else are foundries going to get EUV tech from? Exact entry price? I am going to wait for a small dip and then buy into it. I am late to the party for sure. Applied Materials also a supplier for foundries. No monopoloy like ASML but still very important supplier. 

So why dont I like TSMC as much as ASML and Applied Materials? In the end, they are still a manufacturer. At the mercy of supply demand. Its cyclical. Decent investment but I prefer to invest into monopolies. 

NVDA? Priced too high for my liking but prob just still goes up like TSLA for unexplained reasons. They are KILLING it in GPU and datacentre. AMD exists in this space but NVDA just has the superior tech and mature software stack with CUDA. 

So anyway, whats the TL:DR?

Semi conductor market can only go up imo. Up chunks. Like more than analysts estimate. 

You can capture this better through AMD and ASML than vs Intel (bad tech for now), NVDA (over priced for me but might still just go up). 

I am long AMD. Looking to hold for 10ish years. Maybe this bitch hits 400 a share or something once AMD holds 60% of datacentre CPU. 

Dont play weeklies and stuff. Just buy the stock or if you must do options, do LEAPS. 

""its all priced in"" - is it fuck. Still lots of gains to be had, just cant prediuct weekly prices. 

Not financial advice bla bla bla
3. $100 7/16 x5 calls I BELIEVE ALSO
4. I believe in AMD to the tune of 2$ increases every week doubling my investment over and over.
5. Absolutely love AMD but this is terrible timing for a DD. The train has already been leaving.",30-06-2021 15:33

By the end of Q4 2022, AMD's stock was at $60. In 2024, it neared $220. Despite their recent emphasis on AI, AMD is struggling to provide satisfactory drivers for their GPUs. They also lack optimization for various applications like editing or 3D application, for instance, Blender. Nvidia has consistently smacked them in these areas. Ive always known AMD was lagging behind Nvidia in the software and hardware side. So do you think AMD is all bark and no bite, aka riding the back of Nvidia like some other companies with little regard to their product progress?

Last year, over 3.8 million GPUs were delivered to data centers. With Nvidia's latest B200 AI chip costing around $30,000 to $40,000, we can surmise that Dario's billion-dollar estimate is on track for 2024. If advancements in model/quantization research grow at the current exponential rate, then we expect hardware requirements to keep pace unless more efficient technologies like the Sohu AI chip become more prevalent.

Artificial intelligence is quickly gathering steam, and hardware innovations seem to be keeping up. So, Anthropic's $100 billion estimate seems to be on track, especially if manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel can deliver.

Top Comments:
1. The solution to this problem would be to execute the comeback.
2. I think it’s kinda natural for your financials to look worse when you’re spending so much CAPEX. And I think it will probably continue to slide as a bunch of the actual spending hasn’t happened yet. Of course this will make the stock decrease in the short term.

Losing market share is big concern but I think people underplay how strong a company needs to be (as well as how confident) if they’re spending numbers that end in a B on their future. 

Personally, I like the discount and it’s nice to have some blue sky for the long-term play.
3. He's an amazing CEO, but as Lisa Sue said roughly 10 years ago, ""It takes 10 years in the CPU space to see a plan come to fruition."" (Paraphrasing.)

Basically, he needs to continue to be an amazing CEO for many years before his bigger policies take effect.
4. In a Bloomberg Television interview, **Gelsinger acknowledged that Intel’s comeback won’t happen overnight but slammed Wall Street analysts for sticking to a negative view. The executive said he’s “p---ed” off at what he calls perma-bears.** But Gelsinger believes that others are getting excited about the company restoring its prowess and creating “the new old Intel.”

emvae,finance,"Post: I've never traded stock before, but isn't now the time to buy Square Enix?

As stated, I've never traded stock or cared a whole lot for finance. However, I do think about it abstractly from time to time. Also, keep in mind I've never played a Square Enix game and don't know much about the company itself besides the few articles I've seen on Reddit lately (and obviously their reputation for the FF series).

To elaborate on the reasoning behind my question, Square Enix stock has lost about a quarter of its value so far this year, and will most likely drop lower with the news of its 90% lower net income forecast.

The reason I believe it's almost time (not yet--I think it will drop more) to consider the 'buy buy buy' maneuver with SE stock is threefold:

1. SE has a dedicated customer base. That is; its recent missteps will not affect its ability to sell new titles in the future.
2. By announcing that it is taking time to finish a game ""right"", though that means it must publicly cut its profit forecasts by **NINETY** percent, SE shows that it is truly dedicated to its customers, a hallmark of successful service companies (one could argue that SE provides a boredom management service).
3. SE has a very solid reputation, so it can be expected to continue putting out quality titles.

So, is it not reasonable to assume that in the next couple of years SE will have put out some monster hits? Assuming that happens, will the stock not rise?

Also, I know that SE is traded on the Tokyo exchange and I don't know if it's possible for me to buy it; this is more of a theoretical exercise.

**TL;DR**: Please explain to me any logical fallacies in this series of events:

1. Square Enix makes great games; stock price is x.
2. Square Enix makes a few mistakes that they vow to fix; stock price falls to (x-y)
3. I buy Square Enix stock.
4. Square Enix fixes said mistakes and customers rejoice; stock price returns to or exceeds x
5. Profit?

1. Being both a stock analyst and a serious gamer, I feel like I HAVE to comment here... What you're saying makes complete sense, and you could be on to something, but there are a couple of things you should consider first:
 
* Separate the product from the stock. Square taking the time to perfect the product its selling doesn't necessarily mean the stock will reflect that. If the company suffers financially in the process, then the stock would have an adverse reaction.
* The state of the Japanese game industry as a whole has been brought into question in recent months/years. Many Japanese publishers and developers simply haven't been able to put out many quality games recently, and many people working in the industry (both Japanese and ""Western"") have been commenting on how the Japanese are falling behind on innovation. Do some research, and see which games the major Japanese publishers have put out in 2010, and compare them to the games that Western publishers have put out. Taking this into account, it is difficult for me to say that Square Enix, Capcom, or Konami would return to their former glory any time soon. The one exception to this trend is Nintendo, who has never failed to deliver quality.
* When trading on information like this, you have to really consider whether or not your expectations are shared by other investors, and if so, are these expectations ""priced in"" to the stock already? Does the stock price already reflect the possibility that Square Enix can rebound?
2. >Please explain to me any logical fallacies in this series of events

Time value of money, efficient markets.  Those two should get you started.
3. You have to look a little beyond FF XIV to buy this stock.  Deus Ex: Revolution got delayed, and they had weak console sales from Kane&Lynch, Nier, and Front Mission Evolved.  Plus FF XIV got delayed for PS3.

Talking about FF the multiplayer franchise, it's competing directly with the big kahuna WoW and dozens of other MMOs.  By tanking about as badly as possible with this release, it's going to turn people away from the franchise.  

It seems that they're carrying over 100M yen of cash, net LT debt, on the balance sheet and the company's market cap is 184M yen.  It doesn't seem like the current price expects much future growth in earnings.  

You should also be concerned about exchange rate risk.  The yen has appreciated almost 50% against the dollar in the last 4 years.  A reverse could really kill your returns.
4. Honestly, i would advise against investing in the video game industry at this time. All video game stocks have been stuck in a rut for the past couple of years. I used to own a lot of Activision (which is by far the best financial performer right now), but no matter how much great news there is, the stock has barely moved.

If you think a positive shift in the industry is happening right now, then go for it.

Top Comments:
1. I think the author is really on point here. Just read r/investing or seekingalpha or some other forum with low barriers to entry and you see the same phenomena. People like drama, and there's a convergence towards dramatic opinions and extremes. The scariest part is that while stock valuations are fairly subjective, it is very common to see top reddit comments that are verifiably false, on financial subjects or otherwise.

At some point, I'd really like to take a web scraper to r/investing and see what the relationship between comments on certain companies and their stock performance is. Similarly, it'd be interesting to see if people who are right tend to stick around/people who stick around are more often correct. It'd also be interesting to compare the ""reddit consensus"" with actual analyst consensus and to see where it differs. It might make a good master's thesis. 

On the other hand, I'm not convinced that the traditional punditry is necessarily better. Professionals are generally more articulate and ought to be able to highlight the relevant details in a company or sector. However, the 2 minute segments they have with these professionals on CNBC are basically just noise when compared with hour long analyst calls, and I've never found them particularly useful for extracting more than a very 1000-kilometer high view on a topic that I know nothing about.

I think longer form publications like actual interviews, where the guests are on for a longer period of time, or print articles from WSJ/FT/etc. are still good quality, but even financial media has really been catering to the lowest common denominator with free or televised content.

In any case, I think this really reduces down to an issue of critical thinking. Random internet comments can actually be really insightful, or garbage, but most people can't discern the two. I think the same applies to punditry too, however.
2. LOL. Its gotten harder for those who dont want to change with the times. Tools like sentdex and PsychSignal provide a solid argument against the headline of the article. Its not harder, the methods have just changed. Most people dont understand the methods and thus: ""its gotten harder.""

Harder is entirely relative, for people like me, its gotten easier...

[This algorithm looks for a high volume of bullish tweets about penny stocks and returns 95% in a year.](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/psychsignal-machine-learning-and-penny-stocks-95-percent-in-a-year) 


[This algorithm trades my favorite tech stocks using tweets to determine when to buy. 140% 2016-mid 2017.](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/psychsignal-machine-learning-models-and-tech-stocks) 

I will say that in those algorithms, I throw out more than half the data. To be more correct, I assume half the data is bullshit (people mindlessly reposting, morons talking about shit they dont understand, etc.) 

People, in general, are idiots. The moment you accept this, social media analysis becomes rather easy. 

In my first 3 weeks of trading ever I was up 60% because of Bio Med stocks (i lost it all due to greed, I now always pull out early (lol) as opposed to too late). I didn't know ANYTHING about the bio med market - I let stock twits do all the work (in general, Twitter is actually more correct than stocktwits, which is rather ironic). Once I started trading with algorithms, I automated this process.

Have real analysts been squashed by the short segments they get on TV? sure. but if you are really getting your info from TV, as opposed to just reading it in 1/10th of the time it takes to watch a TV program, thats your fault. These days I feel its best to do the research yourself, read about it online somewhere, or use the high volume of data available with algorithmic trading.

hor85j,amdstock,"Post: Got into AMD early? Thinking of taking profits? Consider selling covered calls TODAY.

We are still riding on high IV from yesterday's pump, so AMD options are at an premium. That's bad if you're a buyer, but great if you're selling. When you sell a covered call, the premiums are credited into your account (you gain $$) right away.

The breakeven price for getting exercised on (someone takes 100 of your shares) is your Strike Price + Premium. So if I sell a $61 Call at $2.50, there is only risk of being exercised IF the price exceeds $63.50.

You can also close out your positions early (buy in) to lock in profits. The best case is that your options expire worthless (you don't buy back at all), but that's added risk of the price moving against you. So the usual charade is to sell  \~45 days out, and buy back in if you're \~50% in the green when \~14-21 days out, then sell again \~45 days out. 

Set a price you will feel good about taking profits at. Bear in mind high volatility events such as ER. This way your shares earn you money beyond just price movements.

6zv2j4,amdstock,"Post: AMD is damned when they show profitable EPS in Q3

We all know Q3 earnings next month = real EPS for AMD for the first time in a long time and that it's very good news for fundamental investors but right now the rut of $13 that AMD has been stuck might not move. Why? When AMD produces real shareholder value the spin will be that it's from the Cryptomining boom. Now the obvious and accurate response is ""NO, just check the CPU, DC and Semi-con sales figures, those aren't GPU's!"". The people making big dollar trades don't seem to know that difference because they're moving money in and out on an industry mix basis instead of a fundamentals basis. So to conclude, no matter how well AMD performs Q3 it will be spun as and reacted to like they couldn't have done it without crypto and ignoring the massive marketshare gains and increase to profit mix. Wait for Navi, wait for 7nm Zen, wait for Raven Ridge and a long ass wait to $20 shares. Staying long but options are looking less and less profitable in the next few months.

qgjb85,amdstock,"Post: Is there any DD on Intel Corp. (INTC) - I’m considering taking a long equity position

I know this AMD & I’m already a long investor, but was looking to potentially add an Intel position also. . . 
I’ve closed several positions and looking for longer term (3 months - 3 years) turnaround plays - I like the current poor sentiment around Intel with their earnings / outlook, and feel that they might be a good candidate.  I like their dividend as a support for price along with the benefits to a long term hold.  

Are there any opinions or bull bear cases for playing Intel long? Or any current holders?

Any other positions you may want to pitch, I am willing to listen.

Thank you.

Top Comments:
1. I am watching Intel as well. However, I think it is way too early to buy. I would be more comfortable in the $30-$40 range. Their competitive products are at least 2-3 years away from providing any kind of competition to AMD, and in the meanwhile, AMD will pull away further. There is a lot of hype about single thread perf and Alder Lake, etc. so we'll have to see where they land with Power & Perf.  Plus they are investing in fabs - I do not know what to make of it - that is a huge Capital Expenditure which Intel can afford, no doubt, but it means that the latest nodes & products based on those are 3 years out. 

As far as dividend goes, it should not be a factor in your assessment, IMHO. If you are really gung-ho on INTC, I would start DCA'ing into it.
2. Intel as a stock is stagnant, really doesn't move much.

1. It will pull back a little bit sometime in the next few months. But you can buy and hold for a few years and be good.
2. I personally don’t think it’s too late! Based on the last two years, AMD has been going straight up.
3. Not too late in my opinion
